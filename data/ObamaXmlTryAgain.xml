    Politics (Obama Is Here)
   </title>
   <lyrics>
    [Ludacris]
Yeah
Okay, okay
Luda!

Hey... I'm back on it
like I just signed my record deal, yeah the best is here
The Bentley Coupe paint is drippin wet, it got sex appeal
Never shoulda hated, you never shoulda doubted him
With a slot in the President's iPod, Obama shouted him
Said I handled my biz and I'm one of his favorite rappers
Well give Luda a special pardon if I'm ever in the slammer
Better yet put me in office, make me a Vice President
Hillary hated on you so that bitch is irrelevant
Now Jesse talkin slick and apologizin for WHAT~?!
If you said it then you MEANT it how you want it, head or gut
And all you other politicians tryin to hate on my man
Watch us win majority vote in every STATE on my man
You cain't stop what's 'bout to happen, we 'bout to make history
The first black President it's destined and it's meant to be
The threats ain't fazin us, the nooses or the jokes
Get off your ass black people it's time to get out and vote
Paint the White House black and I'm sure that's got 'em terrified
McCain don't belong in ANY chair unless he's paralyzed
Yeah I said it cause Bush is mentally handicapped
Ball up all of his speeches and just throw 'em like candy wraps
Cause what you talkin I hear nothin even relevant
And you the worst of all 43 Presidents
Get out and vote, or the end'll be near
And the world is ready for change cause Obama is here

YEAHHH! Cause Obama is here
The world is ready for change cause Obama is here
Yeahhhh, cause Obama is here
Say world is ready for change cause Obama is here
Hey!

    Yes We Can
   </title>
   <lyrics>
    * all Obama lyrics are sampled from a campaign speech in the 2008 NH primary
* Obama and will.i.am's vocals frequently and purposefully overlap throughout

[will and friends singing, Obama speaking]
It was a creed, written into the founding documents
that declared the destiny, of a nation - yes we can
It was whispered by slaves and abolitionists
as they blazed a trail toward freedom - yes we can, yes we can
It was sung by immigrants as they struck out from distant shores
and pioneers who pushed westward against an unforgiving wilderness - wes we can
It was the call of workers who organized
women who reached for the ballots
a President who chose the moon as our new frontier
and a King who took us to the mountaintop
and pointed the way to the Promised Land
Yes we can to justice, and equality

[Chorus: various artists]
Yes we can, yes we can, yes we can, yes we can
Yes we can, yes we can, yes we can, yes we can
Yes we can - ohhhh! We can... (Yes we can!)
Yes we can - ohhhh! We can...

[will and friends singing, Obama speaking]
Yes we can, to opportunity and prosperity
Yes we can, to opportunity and prosperity
Yes we can heal this nation (heal this nation!)
Yes we can repair this world (repair this world!)
Yes we can

[Chorus: various artists]
Yes we can, yes we can, yes we can, yes we can
Yes we can, yes we can, yes we can, yes we can
Yes we can - ohhhh! We can... (Yes we can!)
Yes we can - ohhhh! We can...
S?, se puede!

[will and friends singing, Obama speaking]
We know, the battle ahead will be long
But always remember that no matter what obstacles stand in our way
Nothing can stand, in the way of the power of millions of voices
calling for change
(WE WANT CHANGE! WE WANT CHANGE! WE WANT CHANGE! WE WANT CHANGE!)
(WE WANT CHANGE! WE WANT CHANGE! WE WANT CHANGE! WE WANT CHANGE!)
We want change...we want change... we want change... I want change...
We have been told, we cannot do this
by a chorus of cynics; they will only grow louder and more dissonant
We've been asked, to pause for a reality check
We've been, warned against offering the people of this nation false hope
But in the unlikely story that is America
There has never been anything FALSE about hope
(WE WANT CHANGE! WE WANT CHANGE! WE WANT CHANGE! WE WANT CHANGE!)
(WE WANT CHANGE! WE WANT CHANGE! WE WANT CHANGE! WE WANT CHANGE!)
(WE WANT CHANGE! WE WANT CHANGE!)

[will and friends singing, Obama speaking]
Now the hopes, of the little girl who goes to a crumbling school in Dillon
are the same as the dreams of the boy who learns on the streets of LA
We will remember that there is something happening in America
That we are not as divided as our politics suggests
That we are one people; we are one nation
And together, we will begin the next great chapter, in the American story
with three words that will ring from coast to coast
From sea to shining sea -- YES, WE, CAN

YES, WE, CAN {*repeat 8x*}

[will and friends singing to fade]
Yes we can, mmmhmmm.. ohhhhh, yes we can, yes we can
Oooooooooooooooh, yes we can

   <lyrics>
    [Intro: Bronze Nazareth]
Yo, It's just the thoughts I been thinking and writing
So yeah, Yo, It's that shit be, Yo

[Bronze Nazareth]
Yo I was, Born with that black oil in the veins
Civil War of the brain, Let's dick to the call of the King
Guantanamo Bay, Torture chambers hid in the way
Nigga my kid'll get sprayed if I stay in the ghetto too long
Like Gapetto been pawned
Now the puppet back with the bushes next to the White House lawn
Unemployment checks make us think they trying
I aint buying it, Can't afford it
One slip and it's off into that mental coffin
One mistake, One ticket, One license plate out of date
Lead to jail time cause by bail crime was too much to pay
Had me buying similac with iron while you ate for free
And then rob off employees and they had steak for beef
Like Erwin in the reef, When we burning in the streets
They used to hang us, Bag us, Tag us, Same as Katrina relief
Some say they heard explosions when the levies was breached
Detroit schools shut down, No money to teach
But we in the Middle East setting up Governments for free
Where's the mathematics, Where's casino money from the gambling attics
Automatics, Sort of tragic but it's reaching, Bullets torn across your fabrics
You left us behind with no choice to react quick, Let's widen the gap
Then front a machine to his face, Tyrna kill Africa with aids
Just like crack when it spreads to the people they want relief

(But I aint buying it nigga that's raw beef)
Keep his thoughts to himself though
(But I aint buying it nigga that's raw beef)
He keeps his thoughts to himself though
(But I aint buying it nigga that's raw beef)
I keep my thoughts to myself though
Cause if I don't I don't make it though

Yo, He keep his thoughts with the bushes, Dope pushers, Crack addicts
That's where we stash at, Sky view carries action
Come feel the pulse in my palm, Grip the seal like handle bars
Raised in the slums where graves get dug
Grandma's knit rugs until cancer devourers their thoughts
From floor lights, Spiked tap water in vaults
A cauldron of thoughts stay bake'n in my mind oven
Without pay realize there aint no ways other
Some'll rise in other men when the time is chosen
How could a tree grew up right if the roots is poisoned
Keep the loaded shells spray tucked away, Meet my left deltoid
Grimm Reap make you sleep animation boy
Like bounced checks, Empty clip, Send me fifths to sip
Certified mail, Burning high ale, Smile still

    Unauthorized Biography of Martin Luther King, Jr. and Barack Obama
   </title>
   <lyrics>
    [Shaun Boothe]
Yeah, the unauthorized copy...Special Edition
Dedicated to the dreamer, Martin Luther King, Jr.
My name Shaun Boothe

[Chapter 4]
Born January, 1929
Atlanta, Georgia, they were poor but
He was a good child, from a good home
Read the Good Book, took the good road
And at 15, he was in college now
On the fast track, but on that last lap
Somewhere deep inside, he-he realized
A life serving The Lord, how can you surpass that?
And so he became a preacher, just like his father was
Montgomery Baptist Church, tired but he had to work
'Cause those days, there wasn't much hope if you don't pray
In the segregated South, where they degraded and played us out
He said, "Forget the law, it's okay to disobey and resist
when civil disobedience has a noble cause"
And it's done non violently most of all
Then, along came a seamstress, by the name of Rosa who chose ta
Not give her seat up
When they threw her in jail a movement would erupt
A 380-day bus boycott where Martin was the leader
And so they refused to ride, unified
They would rather walk than pay one fair with laws that's unfair
So they walked, and they walked
Til the city buses were vacant
Like, "We ain't gon' stop, 'til we get desegregation"
Then they gave in...
but our victory was bitter sweet, seeing all that misery
Fast forward, new day, on with the crusade
Next stop Freedom Rides, they continued risking lives
As a group of interracial youth take two
Buses through the deep south, everybody freaking out
Just exercising constitutional rights
And they, beat us wit lead pipes, buses got slashed tires
Bombs through the window, they watched it catch fire
But, Martin, see he knew their violence would backfire
And when it made the evening news, that meant the world was watchin
And the president, had no other option but to hop in..
So in comes The National Guard
And we won that battle, but the war raged on
So young Martin he was back on his job
Went from Albany to Birmingham, really I don't understand
How they can treat a learned man, like he wasn't worth a damn
They took Martin, locked him up
Still he said, "Ain't no stoppin us"
Came out a renewed man
Said, "Let's find a new plan"
They knew that their phones were tapped
So they spoke in code for that
He said to overflow the jails would be the only way
Create a crisis - make 'em negotiate
He was right and ordered segregation be let go
And in '63 they signed King's Manifesto
Fast forward to Selma, Bloody Sunday
Who'da thought this one day
Would be one of the most N-O, T-O ,R-I, O, U-S
The U.S. would ever, know
And they murdered us, hosed us
Beat us, but they couldn't beat us
Demandin our rights to vote, and Martin would lead us
Perhaps his finest hour, is securing our freedoms
Bombs at his home, still he kept goin
Blade through his chest plate, he was back thee next day
In and outta chains, he shouldered the pain
Only thing that could stop him was that bullet with his name, God Bless

[interlude]
The unauthorized biography of MLK, Jr.
From being the youngest person to receive the Nobel Peace Prize
Or his Ghandhian non violent approach to fighting for equality
He's probably most recognized for his Lincoln Memorial Speech "I Have a Dream"
{Free at last, free at last, THANK GOD ALMIGHTY, we're free at last!}
He wasn't alive to see it but that dream came true, and here he is

Born Barack Hussein Obama
Mama white as a dove, father black as they come
Honolulu, Hawaii is where he was first brought up
Growin up he was caught up, playin ball, poor grades
He was just livin up to what Black people were thought of
Til one day he said that's not us, not at all
Buckled down, got into Columbia, Harvard Law
Spun around, right into The U.S. Senate
And after that keynote speech at the DNC, he would be
looked as someone who can lead the way
in a Presidential race for a country in need of change
And when he beat McCain he became
The firsst African American to be elected President
Looking back, they say Martin walked so Obama could run
Three dots 'cause his legacy has just begun...

    Black President
   </title>
   <lyrics>
    [Barack Obama - taken from victory speech in Iowa]
They said this day would never come... {*crowd cheers loudly*}
They SAID, our sights were set too high. {*crowd still wooing*}
This country is too divided; too disillusioned
to ever come together around a common purpose. They said..."

[Repeat 2X]
("Although it seems heaven-sent,
we ain't ready, to have a black president" &lt;- 2Pac)

[singers] {Barack Obama}
Yes we can...change the world...
{CHANGE THE WORLD...}

[Chorus]
("Although it seems heaven-sent,
we ain't ready, to have a black president" &lt;- 2Pac) {repeat 2X}
Yes we can...change the world...
(The world, the world, the WORLD...)

[Nas]
They forgot us on the block, got us in the box
Solitary confinement, how violent are these cops?
They need a early retirement
How many rallies will I watch? I ain't got it in me to march
I got a Semi to spark, the game's in a drought
Public housing, projects, cookin up in the Pyrex
My set, my clique, either gettin money
or runnin from homicide trail, that's if they ain't died yet
Tryna be rich, STILL I'm pledging allegiance
A predicate felon, a ghetto leader
Lendin my poetical genius, to who-EVER may need it
I BLEED this from Queensbridge, now living with my feet up
Never defeated, so a president's needed
You know these colored folks and Negros hate to see
one of they own succeeding
America, surprise us, and let a black man guide us

[Repeat 2X]
("Although it seems heaven-sent,
we ain't ready, to have a black president" &lt;- 2Pac)

[singers] {Barack Obama}
Yes we can...change the world...
{CHANGE THE WORLD...}

[Chorus]


[Nas]
What's the black pres' thinkin on election night?
Is it, "How can I protect my life? Protect my wife? Protect my rights?"
Every other president was nuttin' less than white
'cept Thomas Jefferson and mixed Indian blood and Calvin Coolidge
KKK is like, "What the fuck?!", loadin they guns up
Loadin up mines too, ready to ride
'Cause I'm ridin with my crew - he dies, we die too
Yeah, but on the positive side
I think Obama provides hope, and challenges minds
of all races and colors to erase the hate
and try to LOVE one another; so many political snakes
We in need of a break, I'm thinkin I can TRUST this brotha
...but will he keep it way real?
Every innocent nigga in jail, gets out on appeal
When he wins, will he really care still?
I feel...

[Repeat 2X]
("Although it seems heaven-sent,
we ain't ready, to have a black president" &lt;- 2Pac)

[singers] {Barack Obama}
Yes we can...change the world...
{CHANGE THE WORLD...}

[Chorus]

[Nas]
Say a prayer for "Do we have to?"
You ain't right, Jeremiah Wrong pastor
in love with a slave master
Sincerely yours, USA's most brave rapper
Jesse carjacker, Uncle TOm kidnapper
Ask around, Bently Coupe off the Richter
Bitch called Life, I pimped her, WHAT?
Politics, politricks, Klan shooter
Deacon for defense, progress producer
Nothing on the stove, a survival booster
Gotta DO what we gotta DO
We ain't got no governors comin through to help!
Anything we need done, gotta do for self
New, improved JFK on the way
It ain't the 60s' again, niggas ain't hippies again
We ain't fallin for the same traps
Standin on the balconies, where they shot the King at
McCain got apoligies, ain't nobody hearin that
People need HONESTY!

[Repeat 2X]
("Although it seems heaven-sent,
we ain't ready, to have a black president" &lt;- 2Pac)

[singers] {Barack Obama}
Yes we can...change the world...
{CHANGE THE WORLD...}

[Chorus]

[Governor Bill Richardson]
It is my distinct honor, and privilege to introduce
the next President of the United States - Barack Obama

    Prelude to a Revolution
   </title>
   <lyrics>
    [Sun Rise Above]
They wanna kill me dead, fill my head with bills of lead
Even if I'm found underground I'll still be red
You can kill a man, but can't kill a revolution
Open warfare in the streets - there heads are shootin
I'm talkin bang bang, billion man chain gang
Obama showed you change, but he's givin you the same thang
We've been locked in solid, who lasts for too long
Next time I'm comin through with more than just a new song

    World Today
   </title>
   <lyrics>
    [President Barack Obama sample]
My fellow citizen, we are in the midst of crisis, is now well understood
Our nation is at war, against a far reaching network, of violence and hatred
Our economy is badly weakened, by consequence of greed and
irresponsibility of some

[Trife Diesel]
Aiyo, the world is in a crisis, bad credit and high oil prices
In a world against terror, they telling me I'mma fight rich
I play the nightshift, gun in my hand wit a tight grip
On some hype shit, there's no telling just who I might hit
It's foul, nowadays, kids wilidng, a violent rage
I keep the lights on in the crib, cuz at night, my child's afraid
Hypocritical, pitiful, political views
Giving us clues on the news, but we still are confused
George Bush is the biggest fool, he was ducking from shoes
Better watch what you eat, they putting shit in our food
FDA approved medicines, killing off us Americans
Homes in foreclosures, we being kicked out of residence
It's time to represent, for our next to kin
Before our next to kin go back to slaving in Lexington
They Hyde like Jeckyl and laughing and heckling
That's why I blame politicans for all this mess we in

[President Barack Obama sample]
Today I say to you that the challenges we face our real
Homes have been lost, jobs shed, businesses shattered
Our healthcare is too costly, our schools fail too many
And each day brings further evidence that the ways we use energy
Strengthened our advisaries, and threatened our planet

[Trife Diesel]
We getting laid off, while Bernie Madoff is getting paid off
And government officials is ripping the state off
People with A1 credit can't afford steak sauce
Fear hikes, military airstrikes, letting they K's off
How can I take a day off when poverty is low
Two car notes, life insurance and policies I owe
Economy is slow, unemployment rates sky rocketing
Politicians bidding for positions out in Washington
Money pocketing, in they pant suits and moccasins
And who's to blame for nearly destroying the stock market
And another black male shot again, police open fire
Blew him in his back, and they left him gasping for oxygen
Medicare is never there, I bled in the chair
When Barack got elected, I cried and shed a tear
'08 was a hella year, young people better beware
Watch the crime in '09, cuz I smell it all in the air

[President Barack Obama sample]
The state of our economy calls for action, bold and swift
And we will act, not only to create new jobs
But to lay a new foundation for growth
On this day, we come to proclaim an end
To the petty grievances and false promises
The recriminations and warn out dogmas
That for far too long have strangled our politics

[Trife Diesel]
I'm the brave one like Erica Bane, America's name
Is being tarnished, while honest people is living in carnage
We spend our money on garments, instead of education
We once was the richest nation, now look at our situation
The auto industry begging for a bailout
But who the hell is gonna bail out my brothers outta the jail house
The value of a dollar, nada, white collar criminals
Embezzling tax money from major scholars
Courts litegating, we sit and wait, through all the drama
People still choose to hate over race, look at Obama
The first Black ruler of the free world, we in a recession
Dear God, please bless him, him and his three girls
It's time for a change, look the reign has come
November 4th, we made history, McCain was done
Think twice before you pull out, and name your guns
Let's come together as a whole, and remain as one

[President Barack Obama sample]
You know, the challenges that tomorrow will bring
Our the greatest of our lifetime
A new energy to harness, new jobs to be created
New schools to build, the preps to meet, alliances to repair
The road ahead will be long, the climb will be steep
We may not get there in one year, or even in one term
I have never been more hopeful, than I am tonight
That we will get there, I promise you, we as a people
Will get there

    True Lies

   <lyrics>
    [Intro: "Network" movie dialogue]
I want you to get mad!
I don't want you to protest, I don't want you to riot
I don't want you to write to your congressman
because I wouldn't know what to tell you to write
I don't know what to do about the depression
and the inflation and the Russians and the crime on the street
All I know is that first you've got to get mad!
You've got to say "I'm a human being, God damnit! My life has value!"

[Block McCloud]
Start the uprisin
We'll start the uprisin
It's time to uprise {*2X*}

[Block McCloud]
Listen people they got us believin we nothin but heathens
Screamin hatin each other for nothin but breathin
Hatin each other for color and creed when, me and you
we one and the same under the blade you cut and you bleed
And they think we dumb and naive, but we wasn't conceived yesterday
We know that AIDS they made up the disease
And they tease us with money and greed and make us hunger and feed
off each other like some bloodsuckin freaks
And the most ignorant nigga's a publisher's dream
Nothin but whores and infidelity is up on the screen
Real chance of love with a slut and a creep, a lover that cheats
These dumb broads should be runnin the streets
If you think that lettin your daughters watchin +Charm School+
won't harm you or her in the lonh run you're a darn fool
It's so blatant how they rapin our minds
In plain sight takin our rights, dignity, it ain't right

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
Let's start the uprisin; it's time to cut ties
with these fuckin guys that's feedin us nothin but lies
It's time to uprise; rise up time's up
Cause when the trust dies, love dies, like government spies

[Vinnie Paz]
I'll admit that Obama had me believin the hype
But after doin the knowledge I ain't been sleepin at night
Probably the biggest deception I ever seen in my life
If y'all don't read between the lines then y'all ain't readin it right
Yeah~! Vinnie Paz just a motherfuckin trooper steppin
Nuclear anxiety and the code of the super weapon
Obama and Bush cousins and that's a true connection
Seizin power and property like a ruthless henchman
I'm in the Jewish temple on Mount Zion
Studyin literature from the Priory of Siam
Nothing's safe, no cars, no planes to fly on
I got a few bulletproof vests to try on
Yeah - but y'all can just remain the machine
It's true lies but I decide to stay on my deen
You a sucker if you think that the economy killed
Barack Obama 666 finally revealed

[Chorus]

    Crack Baby Cradles
   </title>
   <lyrics>
    [Intro: Hell Razah]
Ladies and gentlemen, Renaissance Child

[Hell Razah]
We burn rosters and rap labels, when I burp
It's a volcano, I spit lava since the lunch table
From the grave to the baby cradle
I have your favorite rapper handicapped and disable
You like a stepson, I help raise you, disrespectful
And unthankful, to everything that your pops gave you
See this rap shit is half snitching
Feds listening so what's the difference
They point you out and they give descriptions
Just labelled it the music business
Same shit got the youth addicted
It's bullet holes in the kitchen when the dope was missing
Coke sniffing in the board room of Richard Nixon
Too many hitmen, don't trust chaffeurs
We snuff bugs in your Range Rover, and put wires on your gang of soldiers
Nextel got your cell tap, it got cameras where we sell crack
In the ghetto where the wealth's at
It's too bad, cuz they held back
We came strapped like Geronimo Black
Knock 'em down like dominos, where niggas love following cats
They Power Rulez or they Crips, but we Lost Hebrews
Black Jews in the jungle, cuz it's famine of food
Niggas looking at me wrong, cuz I'm handing them jewels
I'm like a wiseman stranded on a planet of fools
The cannon'll move when niggas understanding my shoes
Back up, Raze' and Rubix Cube
And I ain't really gon' fuck with this dude, nigga
Get it right, man

*Barack Obama speech*

    Chemical Warfare
   </title>
   <lyrics>
    [Eminem]
You are now, listening, to the sounds
of Shady, and Alchemist
Alchemist, Alchemist

Got an axe and a duffle bag, couple of fags
stuffed in the backseat, muzzled and gagged
Wrapped in bubble-wrap two lesbians up, couple Hustler mags
And I grab a Pez dispenser, fill it up to the max
with muscle relaxers, the governor of Alaska
She loves when I ask her, shove my Polaski
sausage up in her ass, huh, while we hover over Nebraska
shooting at the fuckin buffalo pasture
in the helicopter, man I can't fuck her no faster
She's screamin "Grab my titties, Shady suck on those bastards"
But I ain't no sucker, I won't snuggle up with her after
I'm a gigolo, but y'all look like a juggalo rapper
Every day man I just seem to get a little bit doper
Shit, back down, man I'd rather lick on a scrotum
And eat the fuckin Octo-mom's pussy lips with some okra
while I watch, Whoopi Goldberg, sizzle with Oprah
While Rosie pussy-farts and takes a piss on the sofa
Get a boner, and play dick-swords with the Jonas
Brothers; your motherfuckin mother's aroma's
like no other, I keep thinkin of her smothered in Somas

It's chemical warfare, drop bombs like Saddam
I'm bringin the drama, like Barack Obama
Playin Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robots with the Octo-momma
I'm vato loco homie, I cock those llamas
For chemical warfare

   <lyrics>
    [Killah Priest]
We tried channelin' the spirits
The killers and dealers and niggas
And go see the essence of the ghetto
The Devil's hell flows over wit lava
Shot us wit revolvers
Gun chargers, help us dear Father
Last night the spirit of a hustler came to me in all black
His lips were cracked, he followed my tracks
His skeleton, half exodus face
He spoke of his fate, its ghost in the race
It left no trace, I just heard a voice
It's tellin' me to make a wise choice
Life is too short; you live it to the limit
I fell lucky for this privilege

(Hook)
So recognize, recognize
Recognize, recognize

[Killah Priest]
Look at life as precious and its essence
Destined for perfection, young ones show regression
Adolescence learn adult lessons of cult progression
Out in Bohemian Grove, nina's and robes
Bathin' in no clothes, goat heads of more lead
In the Middle East rulin' elites
Facts of force hood, the mysteries or Lady Liberty
Killin' spree, niggas is free, not quiet yet
You neva know what your life to expect
Build wit the mind, like mine
Stay wise, civilize, and recognize

(Hook)

[Killah Priest]
For the butyric habits of the doctor's tablets
They both addicts, pharmaceutical is illusional
Still end up in the funeral
I use the musical to display the message
Radios don't play these records
Try downloads or underground shows around the globe
Crown glows on my black hairs, rappers beware
I give you back those years
Priest-Obama, flow drama, coat of armor
The owl and the lion and the Madonna wit child
Stay fly, open ya minds, 3rd eye and listen
And just recognize

(Hook)

    Take Me Away
   </title>
   <lyrics>
    [Ice Cube]
Hahaha, today was a good day
Know what?, sometimes I just get on my knees
You know what I mean?
And pray to the man with the master plan
To swoop on down (swoop on down)
On that mothership, scoop a nigga up...

Lord have mercy, my people so thirsty
Come feed 'em, either Jesus or Muhammad
All we get is vomit, come like a comet
Put it in my brain Lord, put it in my stomach
Only you can run it, I'ma learn from it
Do what I gotta do, try not to plummet
America eats its youth like reptiles
Don't worry bout tomorrow, let's get this right now
They want to run us in the ground
Educate yourself before they dumb you down
Get your money boy, the legal way
Beat 'em with they own bullshit if you may
Now rich white men they got the world fucked up
Why should I give a fuck about a styrofoam cup?
Environmental scene, I'll keep it clean
But if I go green, you know what I mean, bitch

[Chorus]
Take me away from these people
Take me away from these people
(Take me away)
Take me away from these people
Take me away from these people

[Ice Cube]
Ice Cube for President
Let's just do it for the hell of it
See how I'd run the government - make money irrelevant
I might tell a chick, it's illegal to be celibate
Secret Service don't know where the hell I went
Sorry y'all, I had to fuck a Superdelegate
Dream ticket, Ice Cube and Obama
American dream, Ice Cube and yo' mama
The Terminator, are you Sarakana?
Arnold Schwarzenegger, can kill who he wanna?
In California, they strap you to a gurney
And murder yo' ass, in front of your attorney
Do you really wanna take this journey?
Ain't scared of none of y'all motherfuckers like Bernie
Mac (step back) Step back, I got the Mac-11
Unlike Obama, I'ma have to back my reverand

[Chorus]
Take me away from these people
Take me away from these people
(Take me away)
Take me away from these people
Take me away from these people

[Ice Cube]
Now the Lord is my shepherd, my flow is respected
Worldwide, from the West I got to rep it
So please check it, 'cause my style is infected
with the virus, Ice Cube's the Osiris
I bail through, they wanna put me up in Bellevue
Cause my point of view is not red, white and blue
It's black and blue residue
I know what crack can do, to a whole fuckin' avenue
Speak on it and they'll get mad at you
You think I do this bullshit for your gratitude?
I'm a Nigga With a Attitude
I'ma do what I gotta do just to change my latitude
Pimp the system, rollin' with my diamonds glistenin'
And niggaz listenin', from your local prison
I'm a prism, your only vision is a rainbow
in the sky when I spit the ism, come on

[Chorus]
Take me away from these people
(Take me away)
Take me away from these people
(Take me away)
Take me away from these people
(Take me away)
Take me away from these people

    Team America: Fuck Yeah Anthem
   </title>
   <lyrics>
    {Samples taken from the film Team America}

America. America.
America, FUCK YEAH!

[Chorus] [x2]
America
America, FUCK YEAH!

[Verse One] [Indef]
I love the smell of napalm in the mornin'
Drink my hot cocoa to fuckin' get to waring
Kiss my wife goodbye, sniff a couple grams of coke
Can't wait to get in the tank and blow me up a bunch of folks (I'LL FUCK YOU UP!)
Drive through the streets sittin' on top of the Jeeps
Anybody diss America, we got beef (FUCK YOU AND YOUR
Hear Obama pop a lot of pills with Biden
Kumbaya, motherfuckers we ridin'
What's wrong with the world?
What's wrong with the world?
When you can't marry your cousin?
Uncle, I love that little girl (I LOVE HER!)
Rappers lovin' auto-tune, gay parade beats
I will destroy you, no surrender, no retreat
Hop on a plane, take a trip with Bill Clinton
Savin' poor bitches from Korea, got 'em strippin'
Straight dick lickin'
Girls goin' wild
It's Team America, we do it doggy style!

[Talking]
There was a time when America would've dropped a nuclear bomb on Iraq.
And we would have had a big fancy party down in Time Square. (Fuck yeah!)
You see, America is getting soft on me.
Right now as we speak there's little nappy niggers pubes on the presidential pillow cases.
And God forbid the Oval Office start to smell like cocoa butter. (America, Fuck yeah!)
Fuck that shit.

[Verse Two] [Indef]
That's what I'm talkin' 'bout, yeah
WHOOOOO!
Ignorance is bliss
You only take baths and always smell like cumbermint (you smell like a bitch)
I heard you tried to grow nuts and try to assassinate
I don't know, but those shots a bit belligerent
I get loaded and blow away an innocent (sorry)
But Dick Chaney aim, and call the death an accident
Vanessa Hudgens and a bag of sand matchstick (I like 'em young!)
Her 18th birthday and a box of Cealisis
American as apple pie
Cross my heart twice and hope you fuckin' die
We gunnin' through the jungle, like FarCry
Bulletproof doors, stampedes and evil eyes
Keep it pushin' like drive-bys
Hit the blunt and blow the rest of the smoke to the sky
I got grenades and they're all live
And you about to blow, so have a good fuckin' time buddy

[Talking]
You see, my daddy used to always say, "Never do business with a jigaboo."
And that's exactly why I'm breakin' apart from President Obama and putting together an elite team of spys.
These spys will be called Team America: Special Forces.
This team will be the last branch of government that is truly American.

[Verse Three] [Bishop Lamont]
I live Michael Jackson even though he was a nigger
America's the best that's why he made Thriller
Fuck Deb Berrow, I'll kill that hoe
Granny go the kids you ain't gettin' no doe
Got to kill with these terrorists right now but I'll be back
To kill you, John &amp; Kate and all them rugrats
That ain't a show
That shit's fuckin' square
A real American show is Golden Girls, hell yeah!

[Indef]
Eat McDonalds till my heart clogs
Crush Vicodin and sniff it through a drink straw
Let it sink till my sanity stops
Then order a hundred candy bars and chips through pink dot
And cruise the Gaza Strip in a T-top
And let 'em all have it, man we won't stop
I'ma shoot you in the stomach till your shit drops
John Ritter syndrome, make your heart stop

[Talking]
Okay fellas, what I'm about to tell you is top secret.
For years Adam Sandler has been foolin' America into believing all Jews are friendly.
If Adam Sandler makes one more movie, everyone will become Jewish.
Your first mission is to find Adam Sandler and destroy him. Good luck.
(America, FUCK YEAH!) (Bitch)

    That's That

   <lyrics>
    Already woke, spare the joke, barely spoke, rarely smoke
Stared at folks when properly provoked, mirror broke
Here, share strawberry morinin,
Gone and more important spawnin'
Torn in, poor men sworn in
Cornish hens switchin positions, auditionin' mortitions
Saw it in a vision, ignorin prison
Ignoramuses enlist and sound dumb
Found em drowned in cows dung, crowns flung
Rings a tinkerbell, sing for things that's frail as a fingernail
Bring a scale, stale ginger lingers
Seven figures invigor
Nigga, fresh from out the jail, alpha male
Sickest ninja injury this century, enter plea
Lend sympathy to limper simple simon rhymin emcees
Trees is free, please leave a key
These meager fleas, he's the breeze
And she's the bees knees for sheez
G's of Gs seize property, shopping sprees
chop the cheese drop degrees to stop diseases gee wiz pa!
DOOM rock grammer like the Kumbaya
Mama was a ho hoppa, papa was a rollingstone
Star like Obama, pull a card like oh drama!
Civil liberties
These little titties abilities riddle me, middle C
Give a MC a rectal hysterectomy
lecture on removal of the bowels, foul technically
Don't expect to see the recipe
Until we receive the check as well as the collection fee
More wreck than section Z
What you expect to get for free?
Shit from me, history
The key, plucked it off mayor
Chucked it in the ol tar pit off La Brea, playa
They say he's gone too far
DOOM'll catch em after Jumar on cue lacka!!
Do what'cha gotta do, grarrrr the rumors are not true, gotchu (got you) ma
No prob, got the job, hot barred heart throb
Scotch Guard the bar the with cotton swabs, dart lob
Bake a cake, sweet
Jamaica trade in treats on the beach make her skeet til her feets meet

Can it be I stayed away too long?
Did you miss these rhymes when I was gone?
As you listen to these crazy tracks
Check them stats then you know where I'm at
And that's that

    [Intro: Vinnie Paz]
Yeah~!! Heavy Metal Kings, BRRAP
Yo Bill whattup baby?
Yeah... BRRAP BRRAP BRRAP BRRAP BRRAP
Hahahahaha

[Vinnie Paz]
Y'all should stop rhymin
I'm a G, hard body, I am not common
This is destiny, it's not luck, it's not timin
And Vinnie stayin in the hood like he Top Ramen
I ain't ready for the stage until my fourth quart
I'm the definition of bully, a poor sport
However you want it we can do it on your court
My sword'll cut your shit in half like it's divorce court
I have G in my blood cause my pops had it
The straight left hits hard like it's Scott Travis
I don't fuck with anybody who is not Savage
The GSG-5 leave your block ravished
I'm not sick, I control the disease
I got llamas but not the ones that Napoleon feeds
Even the most protected soldier could bleed
Me and you ain't nothin alike, we a whole different breed

[Chorus: Ill Bill]
Yo, sawed-off or automatic, my aura cause static
Drawmatic anarchy volcanic is organic
Heavy metal emperors, kings on the planet
Bring whores and Xanax, think more satanic
Ex' pills, vicodins, OCs, powder
Haze, OG, kush, diesel, and sour
Dust, chews, loosies, turbans, and kufis
Handguns, rocket launchers, shotguns, and Uzis

[Ill Bill]
Imported Italian leather sofas Valencia, shooters imported from Chechnya
Put 'em underneath the dirt, with the rest of ya
The skull and crown on the sword, four pound on ya boy
cause entire crowds to applaud, ten thousand or more
Can never be contained, lyrically deranged, clinically insane
Critically acclaimed, I keep the industry afraid
They've been super nervous ever since we escaped, goons with burners
Destiny betrayed, refuse to lose or ever be a slave
A picture's worth a thousand words but a symbol is worth a thousand pictures
We never fully understood the symbols found in scriptures
Swastikas spraypainted on the pyramids
Sometimes I feel like we're just an experiment
Gold fronted up top to bottoms, cock the llamas
Mossad, Osama, jihad, Obama, call me the skullhead
Like Four Horsemen combined in one warhead
You fuck around I'll detonate and leave you all dead

[Chorus]

    [Jethro the Rappin' Redneck]
Yes uhh, welcome back to uhh
What the fuck is the name of the show again? (YEE-HAW~!)
Yeh okay, welcome back to The Yee-Haw Album
My name is Cuddin' Jethro Calhoun
Your friendly radio deejay and host
And today our special guest is Chief Chinchilla
This nigg-err I mean this brother is from New York City
He's a Northern boy
He's down here promotin his malt liquor jingles LP
But we have to let him KNOW, that we have our own beer down here
Yes we do it's called Hillbilly Beer, yes it is

[Chief Chinchilla]
Hillbilly Beer! The fuck?!

[Jethro the Rappin' Redneck]
Let me tell you about it (YEE-HAW~!)

Hey Chief Chinchilla, dolo bird killer
I'm a boss hog and I don't drink Miller
But everytime, I roll through the South
I gotta put a Hillbilly Beer to my mouth
Go to a hoedown and make a hoe go down
Put frostin on my dick and put the 40 to my lips
and sip... my Hillbilly Beer
Cause ain't no fuckin St. Ides around here

Boss Hog go tell Daisy Dukes get her big titty ass in here
and bring me my fuckin beer BITCH!

[Chief Chinchilla] Why y'all be drinkin that Hillbilly Beer?
[Jethro R.Redneck] Cause they don't got no niggaz 'round here
[Chief Chinchilla] Man why y'all be drinkin that Hillbilly Beer?
[Jethro R.Redneck] Cause we don't like 50 Cent around here
[Chief Chinchilla] Yo why y'all be drinkin that Hillbilly Beer?
[Jethro R.Redneck] Cause we don't like Obama'round here

[Chief Chinchilla]
Alright I had about enough of this redneck shit

    Better With the Lights Off
   </title>
   <lyrics>
    [Chorus 1: Chris Brown]
You're a dime, so beautiful
Top of the line, so unusual
Words can't define, been runnin through my mind all day (daaaay, daaaaay)
I'm so happy you're mine - (So beautiful)
Top of the line - (So unusual)
Now I think it's time - Hey, shawty
I hope you don't take this the wrong way

[Chorus 2: Chris Brown]
Girl, you look better with the lights off
Better with the lights off
Oooooooooooooooooh-oooooooooooooh
Girl, you look better with the lights off
Better with the lights off
Oooooooooooooooooh-oooooooooooooh
(Baby girl, you better with the lights off)

[Legacy]
(Oh) Hey Miss America
(Oh) what you look so sad for?
Sweetheart, you only live one time
So put your fantasies on fast forward
Life, gon' speed me up
Got a deadline, 'cause you need me time
I hate yo' type, I love you too
I bite yo' swag cause I wanna do, you!
Huh~! Cain't blame me, babe
Obama you work clothes, girl make a change
to your, lingerie, right like that
That la-la-lah make ya eyes roll back
...I mean, you already fine though
I just wanna see you with the lights off
Every guy wanna know how it is
to clap off the lights and turn Khloe to Kim

[Chorus 1 + 2]

[Ben J]
Ugh~! Drive off, take my girl to have a nice day
She was right so I let her hang my way
You look cute, girl what'chu wanna do, girl?
Drive to my house, 'cause it's only me and you, girl
I'm checkin her out, she had to put her swag on
Actin too happy, sayin she ain't goin back home
I'm like, "Wow, whatever you say
but whatever you plan, gotta be done at 8"
Next stop -- party at my place
Of course you welcome girl, you ain't takin up space
We get there, but shawty STILL lookin right
She attacked me, but wait let me dim the lights
Oh you look different, she like, "Boy, stop it!"
Naw, I ain't playin, actually you more poppin
She said, "Shocking, no that's really raw"
All over baby, even with the lights off

[Chorus 1]

    Overture of Mankind
   </title>
   <lyrics>
    Verse 1

I arose in mist,by an obelisk, emerge a glowing disc
Many are called but few are chosen to expose the gift
I blow the piff, strategize on how to co exist
With hopelessness thoughts provoking kids with open wrist
Unload the fifth, avoid the callous voice of malice
Destroy the palace,your drinking from a poisoned chalice
Deploy chariots, june brought the food for thought
Subdue your fort with brutal force,marx the cruel sort
And through the path of life,pursue the parasite
With Gruesome apetite consume a human sacrifice
Disaster strikes, like the paragon forces,
They travel on horses ride through babylon fortress
came to inherit,claim a message
Plus they brought the frame of the relic,your name on the death wish
From pain you will perish, finish foe with wicked flow
The hidden scroll turn your inner soul bitter cold

Hook:

And they watch us from a distance
24/7 like they clocking our existance
I plot for the resitance can't stop the mission
I speak from the heart disregard the opposition

Verse 2

I look at life through disturbed lens
Contemplating how the world ends
Prophets waiting for the hurricanes and whirldwinds
I burn a stem, inner peace I can't find
Middle eastern landmine wicked beast of mankind
So I recline, they unworthy of attention
losing early worshipping earthly possesion
Learn the lesson,america loves the devil
On june 4th,and so was born another rebel
Seek him out,his thoughts what he speaking bout
He without faith is lost in a sea of doubt
And I remain calm,while they claim hardest
More trees than the amazon rainforest
Trained forces,snakes will reign lawless
Regardless obama or mccain in the office
They all the same, just a different colored puppet
Corrupt the budget, and gain the trust of the public

    Stir of Echoes

   <lyrics>
    (Intro)
T.H.U.G. Angelz, drink up brother
Heaven Razah
After you drink this you won't be thirsty again
Sometimes they ask me
Yo how the hell do you come up with the shit you come up with when you writing songs?
And I tell 'em

(Chorus) 2x
My mind is not here
My soul it travels in air
Is that more voices I hear?
Their souls they crying I'm clear

[Hell Razah]
Thug Angelical aura, use the metaphor to light the menorah
Louis V. on this yarmulke, I open the Torah
Me and Seraphim was sent in to slaughter Gomorrah
Pop two out the four corner in ya fedora
It's Amun Ra at the Mardi Gras
But gave my body to Yah Shabbat Shalom
To the brothers Rabat
And all my homies on lock 23/in the box
With an ox hitting the under the crotch
Or got one in the qaad
Since daycare was running they blocks
With a blood-clot, robocop with one arm
Log on to my www dot doctor dot com
Hear the songs of the future in digital form
Where cyber adultery or virtual porn
Another dead man walking, and criminal's born
Newlywed's on their honeymoon, the children's is mourn
You've been warned on YouTube and given the jewels
Come and build with a carpenter that's fixing the screws
Halliburton is emerging more prison with schools
The FDA got a serpent that be serving us food
We've been fooled by Obama, just look at ya grandmama
Same snake in the garden became an anaconda
Been reborn like Malcolm when he took his Shahada
They bow down and they honor to my lyrical Ka'ba
I tell 'em "Thou shalt not worship anything but the Father"
But worship my lyrics
Yo Razah? Yo Razah man?
I tell 'em "Thou shalt not worship anything but the Father"

(Chorus) 2x

    Exhibit A (Transformations)
   </title>
   <lyrics>
    I spit that Wonderama shit, me and my conglomerates
Shall remain anonymous, caught up in the finest shit
Get that type of media coverage Obama get
Spit that Kurt Vonnegut
That blow your brain Kurt Cobain, that Nirvana shit
Who gon' bring the game back
Who gon' spit that Ramo on the train tracks
That gold rope, that five-finger ring rap
Runnin' with my same pack
You can find the Christ where the lepers and the lames at
Life is like a dice game:
One roll could land you in jail or cutting cake, blowing kisses in the rice rain
Nice whip, nice chain, a closet of skulls
The stench is like slave blood at Providence Hall, yeah
They built my city on top of a grave
Nigga die, nigga get high and watch the parade
Back in the early '90s
"Where they at, where they at?
Get the gat, get the gat" was a popular phrase
Bally Animals and Rugbys was a popular craze
This the vivid memoirs of a obnoxious slave
I pave ways like Nat and Harriet
I blast on Judas Iscariot and peel off in the chariot
I'm sitting pretty, spitting flames, gripping grains
Ain't a damn thing changed

They say "Candyman, Candyman, spit me a dream
Blow a chunk of the levee out and spit me a stream
Knock a man's house down and build a casin-
A $2000 government check from FEM-
I swam down shit's creek and came up clean
With a new lease on life like Andy Dufresne
Its the most poetical, Nat King unforgettable
Clarence 13X Allah's rhapsody from Bellevue
I'm splittin' atoms, spittin' flames
Bringin' change, things will never be the same
I got the rap game singing "At Last" like Etta James
Lames get they plane shot down like John McCain
It's a dream, it's a dream
The flow is elegant like Miss Coretta Scott King
A lot of kings seen death and turn queen
Crack they 24-inch rims in the ravine
Respect the architect, never test the Elohim
Goodnight: this is Jay Elec, live from New Orleans

    The Reserves
   </title>
   <lyrics>
    ['Marvin the Martian' sample]
Dear, this is most inconvenient
Now I'll have to call out the reserves

[Chorus 2X: Raekwon]
Aiyo, drugs from Philippines, guns and guillotines
Murder land triflers in the hood with killa genes
Car hard jumpers and seeds is gold robers and them cheebas
Fresh off the block, note the leeches

[N.O.R.E.]
Aiyo, machine gun rap, Maybach floor mats
Panel door suicidal, you see my rivals
Keep the sour puss face, I keep the kush case
Phillies unravel, Earth smoke spending with me
Afghanistan headband, that straight sticky
Empty pillow cases with the soda and the soap in them
With my Indian niggas that only sling opium
It's Shallah, my Chinese dudes, take they Shahada
In sweatshops, cutting them things from Guatemala
My rosary beads is blessed, came from the mountains
Used to sell dust juice, water like a fountain
I meditate in a room full of rich rugs
Stretch coke like yoga, deep like Yoda
My chronic is green they call it Shrek like ogre
Militainment, Icewater, water that freezes
Them hand to hand on the block with them pieces

[Chorus 2X]

[Capone]
Check this military regime, mafia, guns from Czechoslovakia
We eating bread getting stockier
Army apparel, draped in the Vatican, you rocking that last year
The bulletproof vessels is cashmere
Burning in a hostler, or toast ya
The east coast go Cosa Nostra, heart cold as Nova Scotia
Ramble like Che Guevara, I ran the Reagan era
Word to mama, now I smoke Obama in a grey Carrera
That's presidential kush, blowing outta bongs that fiber glass
Seventeen thirty eight Remy
The semi hold bullets that size of a little penny
Block stars, not a rock star rocking my jeans skinny
For parole violating fugitives on a run, son
Live by the gun, son, die by a dumb dumb
It's not where you at, it's where you come from
Laundry mat travel wash money by the lump sum, get it

[Chorus 2X]

    Carbon Footprint
   </title>
   <lyrics>
    [Intro]
Dr. Greenthumb
Captain Planet with a Xanax
The Karl Strot of hip-hop
With birds like Hitchcock
Fuckin gas is too expensive man
Better send some more fuckin troops
Start a fuckin draft, {?} gas
Fucking barbecue, punch you in the grill

[GDP]
You can plant a garden, eat some calamari
And give the earth back to the jellyfish we started from
New Orleans, Haiti, Bahamas
Obama's mobster ass cigars in our garages
It's like Chuck D meets Charles Darwin
Spark it far from borrowin a parked Bentley orange
We sent waste into space for Martians
And pour a little oil out for my dead lobsters
Scientists gargle jargon about
how air got more led in there than oxygen
To a Congress that doesn't acknowledge
Cause they're in the wallets of monster conglomerates
Got bargained for carbon, forests beg our pardon
Waste enough garbage to feed the ones starvin
Bargain for carbon, greenhouse exhaustion
New-fangled energy vs. modern economics
.. you can almost smell the carcass
Bones growing weaker, heart pumping harder
Storms more often, summer's getting warmer
Geo molded toxins cockblock farmers
Went to the market to cop something processed
Every other product got a cancer ribbon on it
If a tree falls then there's no more forest
They'll measure regional climate using yardsticks
In a hybrid with a bitch getting carsick
Start it like George Carlin, I'm Johnny Carson
I told her, darlin, home is where the heart is
Nothing lasts forever, except water bottles
... water bottles
Bargain for carbon, million man marches
Hotheaded sergeants that call war progress
Praying men to kill with foreign objects
No big contract, oil drilling prospects
Want to leave but the borders are guarded
like mold in the wall of my apartment - catharsis
Now they're vaccinating kindergarteners
Tree farms and chemicals that wind up in our drinking water
Bargain for carbon
Conglomerates bargain for carbon
We're ruining the land we stole
But you don't feel responsible
You don't feel responsible
So let the next of kin pay our carbon toll

   <lyrics>
    [Intro]
As we proceed!

[Royce]
Yeah. Ayo, Statik Selektah

[Statik Selektah]
What up Royce?

[Royce]
You know how motherfuckas been like
"Since that nigga Royce got back he's been focused than a motherfucka"

[Statik Selektah]
It's smash squad

[Royce]
God damn right. It's the Bar Exam niggas. Yeah, yeah yeah Yeah

Verse One:
I pack llamas
Come at me I react Osama
You wack flow bomber
You asshole, ask your momma
Best known in the past for drama
I got Pac's persona
Topped with the mind of Barack Obama
That's me
Viva me at my leisure
I be any ?
? on my Visa
Me and my skeezer
My heat on the seat of vehicle, next to me rollin'
My neck frozen like it's supposed to be in my freezer
Rims and tires
It's Tims and higher
And nigga we don't rent we buy 'em
And that's prolly why y'all scary
Y'all dudes is punks cause y'all shoes on y'all coups and dunks
Is all cheaper than Mulberry's
On the contrary
I'm back and I'm not stoppin'
Model on the back while I'm cat walkin' a crotch rocket
We flier
Cease fire
We gonna keep ridin' till we need tires
You prolly should keep quiet
You niggas think that just because it's dope it's phony
Since I'm God sent that you really supposed to stone me
Cause I rhyme sick, that I won't put cheese up
And put out hits, on niggas faster than Interscope and Sony

Chorus:
If they throw you in the cage what you do?
Think about it
Then what?
Man up
And then what?
Get up out
And then what?
Go Gettem'! [x3]
Welcome to the Bar Exam
If he diss you in a rhyme what you do?
Let him do it
And then what?
Let him drop
And then what?
Let him flop
And then what?
Go Gettem'! [x3]
If he diss you in a rhyme what you do?

Let him do it

And then what?

Let him drop

And then what?

Let him flop

And then what?

Go Gettem'! [x3]

    [Soul Khan]
Soul Khan... Brown Bag
I don't do this type of shit very often
You should feel blessed

Well as I wake the dead, shake your head, disconnect your neck and spine
You David Guest, I'm Dave Koresh, resurrectin live
Soon as we step to y'all, all I hear is "never mind"
How the fuck you put a tether ball against a wrecking Khan?
I am on a level like the naked eye could never find
You tried to defy death and I guess I will death defy
I caught him thinkin that we'd rest, inside of my chest
designed by Tony Stark with the pressure, high when the professor died
This is not an afterthought - this is an aftershock
They say my catalogue is somethin like an act of God
I got the keys to take your shackles off
Sort of like I'm Clark Kent, but I don't have to ever take my glasses off
I'm rough around the edges but they spread it like it's hot Nutella
Create the future like Obama when he knocked Michelle up~!
Even my acapella's similar to salmonella
Forget the wine, they better get my crew a VODKA cellar
You probably wonderin where the smoothness and swag at
I don't know; check the roads between Fallujah and Baghdad
You perusin the handbags, I'm boozin with granddad
I stopped readin when I see you usin a hashtag
Bitch say I'm hatin! So electrical
They selectin Soul and case awaiting
I'm gettin impatient waiting, so if it don't happen soon
the dude gon' be where the in-patient's layin
I'd give my life to keep the city shinin
Cause the difference is, I don't need a hype machine to hypnotize 'em
All that for nothin - y'all make me earl with it
Fuck it, give me yo' budget, I'll save the world with it~!
And that's my word...
Now get the fuck out my house

    Ghetto Blaster
   </title>
   <lyrics>
    [Boots Riley]
Listen to the, shotgun sonata from personas non grata
With a plot to rock harder than the secta intafada
I do, drink firewater but I'm more like Hiawatha
and will slaughter, slaughter, slaughter, your armada
Inform your scholars that our alma mater's squalor
So my squad'll pull your collar at your black-and-white gala
We're canon fodder for dollars both under Bush and Obama
I'm not a baller I'm a brawler callin y'all to come harder

[Chorus]
And I'm a Ghetto Blaster
Cause I'm a Ghetto Blaster
See I'm a Ghetto Blaster
I'm a ghetto, I'm a ghetto, I'm a ghetto, I'm a Ghetto Blaster!!!

[Boots Riley]
I'm from the land o' the free labor that planted the plan of the
black-and-branded to scram it over to Canada
A fan of radical bandits and bandanas
who slammed in the banana clip and rat-a-tat-tat-tatted-a
They spat the grammar to scam y'all to clamor up
The damn ladder to grab for Excalibur
Not a rap battler, but the next calibre
Catch the program and not just my pentameter

[Chorus]

[Interlude]
PULL THE TRIGGER~!
C'mon and help me out!
Said help me out!
Need y'all to help me out!
C'mon and help me out!
Help me out!
C'mon and help me out!
Need y'all to help me out!
Help me out!

[Boots Riley]
Cause I'm a Ghetto Blaster
Yeah I'm a Ghetto Blaster
I'm a Ghetto Blaster
I'm a ghetto, I'm a ghetto, I'm a ghetto, I'm a Ghetto Blaster!!!
I'm a Ghetto Blaster {*3X*}
I'm a ghetto, I'm a ghetto, I'm a Ghetto Blaster motherfucker!

    Maybach Music 2 (Remix) *
   </title>
   <lyrics>
    * original "Maybach Music 2" appeared on Rick Ross' "Deeper Than Rap"

[Chorus: T-Pain]
Hey! Realest shit I ever wrote, chilling in my Maybach
Whatever I send out, homie I'ma make back
Hey! Can you believe that? (whoooooa)
You gotta see it, hey!
I don't plan on going broke, put that on my Maybach
cause I'm in it to win now, niggas can't take that
Listen to my Maybach music, to my Maybach music

[Jay-Z]
It smell like summertime to me! {"What is this?"}
First one to cop, I'm the Maybach muse
First one in the coupe, I'm on my third six-deuce
White guts, black Benz
I call that bitch Affirmative Action
Oreo, the Obama
Curtains drawn, they can't see me, Osama
Cashmere throws, that's a splash of class
S.C. initials on the Tiffany glass
I guess on the initial Maybach
I was way too official, they ain't call Jay back
I'm just a bully, I apologize
and if you would've asked, I probably would've lied
Huh, this better, no pressure
as my mind reclines on white leathers
I think back to my first Maybach
Baby blue sides, I called her my Similac
Six-deuce every time, I never had the Heinz
Fifty-seven can't catch up to mines
No diss to Ricky, this his song
But everybody know this the shit that I been on
No fives, no four-point-ohs
So no partitions, a no-no for Hov' {"Sweet"}
I'm a just a top-drawer nigga
Penthouse every time, I'm a top-floor nigga
As I drift off further
Chauffeur serves the city, observers
Oohs and ahhs, they know who's inside
Though I never touch the wheel, I won't lose my drive
Oohs and ahhs, they know who's inside
On the factory shoes, I won't lose my stride

[Chorus: T-Pain]

    A Billi
   </title>
   <lyrics>
    {*set to the same beat as Lil Wayne's "A Milli"*}

[Jay-Z]
Guru turn this shit up (OW!)
I know a million people already did this
Let's make it a billion
Get busy, happy birthday my nigga

Geah, a billi, a billi, a billi a billionaire
Call me Philly Collins, I feel a billion is in the air
I affiliate, with Billy Cakes, that's my pair
And Jah-ma-nillionaire is my consigliere
When I wear, Billionaire, Boys Clubs it's more than care
I don't wear it cause Pharrell, I wear it cause I'm fo'real
{*I SEE DEAD PEOPLE*}
I see Benjamins and a billion other big head people
I'm a natural born hustler, Marcy Projects motherfucker
Turned professional journalist reportin, live from the gutter
My girl, carry boxcutters, rubbers, shoot up with undercovers screamin
FUCK THE WORLD, why, cause, don't nobody love us
Shawn Carter, Sean Bell, what's the difference? Do tell
50 shots or 50 mill', ain't no difference go to hell
So, BRRRAK, lick a shot for, BRRRACK Obama, change gon' come-ah
I'ma buy the whole hood llamas on me
Roc nation army, million strong and the mantra's gon' be
It is whatever it's gon' be, on three
Shawn, in the Hum V, y'all can call it cold warm
Declarin, I'm free, bumpin 'Pac and the Outlawz
I'm flyer than all outdoors, I ball out pours
I buy, champagne companies, I'm past buyin out bars
But I do that, I'm so past, G5's and G4's
But I flew, back, back and forth like Aaliyah (rest in peace to ya)
Takes a nation of millions to hold us back
But when your boy reach a billion it's a wrap (off of RAP?) YEAH!
Roc nation it takes a nation to stop
I'm signin off, it's the hood's Barack, BRRRACK!

Motherfucker I'm ill!
Motherfucker I'm ill

    What If
   </title>
   <lyrics>
    [Jadakiss]
Yo, take a second
What if we could rewind the hood?
Better yet, what if the Lox woulda signed wit Suge?
What if Puffy neva signed us?
What if Oprah made them comments like Imus?
What if you designed us?
Thought like I did, said it like this
What if Payton was fightin' dogs instead of Mike Vick?
What if Arnold woulda just let Tookie get Life?
What if BIG missed the party?
What if Pac missed the fight?
What if you was caged in?
What would you change then?
What if there was no Rockefeller law for made men?
What if hate ran thru me?
And what if Portland woulda drafted Jordan instead of Sam Bowie?
What if you really had to be nice to get a deal?
What if all of these rappers ice was really real?
What if I hit you wit the razor from cheek to chin?
What if Mike Jackson neva woulda bleached his skin?

(Hook) Jadakiss 2x
What if you neva knew things that you needed to know?
What if you neva been places you needed to go?
What if you get there and learn them as you go?
What if is the question, can I ask them once more?

[Jadakiss]
What if the pain went away?
What if you changed in a day?
What if you could eliminate all the games people played?
What if Shyne beat the case?
What if Diddy did a dime flat?
What if Nelson Mandela could give his time back?
What if Malcolm was silent?
What if Martin was violent?
What if you could really sneak an Uzi on the Island?
Yeah, what if I make you kiss the nina?
What if a brick was only just a misdemeanor?
What if Manhattan was hit by Hurricane Katrina?
What if a Black man was the one controllin' FEMA?
What if we ain't neva let emotions come between us?
What if the last time we rode somebody seen us?

(Hook) Jadakiss 2x

[Nas]
Yo, I flow calm but don't push
What if Saddam hung Bush?
What if 'One Mic' was called one hook?
What if the Bridge neva showed me how to hold a weapon?
What if I ran up in that sick shit wit no protection?
What if I neva wore an Army jacket?
Carhartt to match it, unlaced Timbs
The hood on my first album cover under plastic
What if I was another corny rapper?
What if I went instead of Notorious?
Who would tell my story after?
What if I love less and lust more?
If Obama was on Rushmore
Would Ali give Tyson a bust jaw?
What if I neva glared out that project window?
Would neva be scared for the life of me and my kinfolk
What if that gun pin broke?
I would neva linked back in the Enzo, all red
What if real niggas was all dead?
What if Hilary and them was Reptilian?
And 2012 was the end of men and all world civilians?

   <lyrics>
    [Intro: Excerpt from New Jack City]
Rastaman, I'm here to tell you Nino Brown says
"Your services are no longer needed in the community"

[Edo G]
A&amp;E!!! Uh! Uh huh! A&amp;E yeah! Hey! Yo! Hey! Yo!

[Verse One: Edo G]
Barack Obama, we need change
How many rappers in the game have little in front of their name?
Lil' Wayne, Lil' Boosie it's a lil' shame
Lil' Flip, Lil' Cease yo they not the same
Lil' Wyte, Lil' Mama, where Lil' Zane?
Little Brother, Lil' Jon, and Lil' Fame
Real hip hop, not about your lil' chain
Lil' Keke, Lil' Kim a lil' freaky
Lil' Fizz, Illegal with Lil' Maliky
Lil' Mo, Lil' Bow Wow had beef with Lil' Romeo
A lil' teenager told me so
Lil' Scrappy, keep my hair a lil' nappy
A lil' bit cause I talk a lil' shit
You gettin half bread
Unlike that rapper Lil' 1/2 Dead, you lil' bastards
Your lil' rhymes and lil' lines they fillin in
Big Ed O, lil' rappers I'm belittlin
There's Lil' Young, I'm admittin you a lil' young
Big mouth like Whodini for your lil' tongue
Hey rappers now where's your lil' gun?

[Chorus: Masta Ace] (Edo G)
Understand where I'm comin from?
Nope you probably don't, that's cause you a little young
(UH HUH! UH HUH!) That's cause you a little young
(I KNOW! I KNOW!)  That's cause you a little young
Understand what I'm sayin son?
Nope you probably don't, that's cause you a little young
(OK! OK!) That's cause you a little young
(I KNOW! I KNOW!)  Boy you a little young

[Verse Two: Masta Ace]
Yo, I wonder after all these years and all the fame over
As a young emcee, could I take the game over?
I'll sign with Young Money, get rich dumb easy
Young boys get, +PUT ONNNNN+ like Young Jeezy (YEAAAH)
Up in the club, it's so gung-ho
Makin it rain, I'ma hang with Yung Joc and Young Dro
Up in the VIP, wit some young girl
Wearin them young clothes, +Hey Young World+
You got Yung Hot, Yung Berg, and Young City
He from "Making the Band", used to run with Sean Diddy (take dat!)
Remember Youngstas? Now we got Yungstar
Too young to buy a drink, drive they own car
You got Young Buck, Young B, and Young Tay (who?)
I'll play Andre Young instead of Young Dre (Dr.)
It's no subliminal dis but, someone'll find it
You say Young Chris/Kris, I'm thinkin 'bout "Criminal Minded"

[Chorus: Masta Ace] (Edo G)
Understand where I'm comin from?
Nope you probably don't, that's cause you a little young
(UH HUH! UH HUH!) That's cause you a little young
(I KNOW! I KNOW!) That's cause you a little young
Understand what I'm sayin son?
Nope you probably don't, that's cause you a little young
(OK! OK!) That's cause you a little young
(I KNOW! I KNOW!) Boy you a little young

    Porn Star

   <lyrics>
    [Verse One]
He-he-hello Mrs. Ex-Girlfriend
You came back, I hear it's cause you left your male
'Kay, that's cool, that's cool, come and take a seat
That's messed up, y'all split and you nearly made a week
AHH! Well-well you can meet Mrs. Batteries
She the reason why you gone on some magic shit
One difference between y'all is she like to say trim
She got rid of the Bush like Obama came in
And you broke, need the bank to spendin
So put us in your pants like Chelsea Handler
You not me just tinselhead go 'head gamble
But they mistake you for a bitch like Chelsea Grammar
But it's cool, cause I know it's not legit
You just hella insecure and like to talk a shit
But don't mistake for bein a 9 when you greased up
That's why {?} threesome, so what's it been?

[Chorus]
You talk a lot talk a lot of shit (yessir)
We ain't talkin no more talk about my chick (yessir)
But ain't talkin 'bout 'em now the shit begin
Yeah you'd probably whup her ass but she treat me like a
Treat me like a porn star, like a porn star {*4X*}
Treat me like a...
My chick look badder than yours ahh
She sucks today, you wet it then you
like a porn star, like a like a porn star {*2X*}

[Verse Two]
Lift a couple racks, do for shorty what she want
Everything swag, my girl Louis in the trunk
And I know I probably mentioned that I awesome
Hit the do', take a +Powerpuff+, +Blossom+
My old girl got nothin on my new chick
She fucked me like a porn star, you ain't do shit
Fine young swag grown and committed
My girl workin good I had to maker her my assistant
Old chick politic, go mingle
New Boyz are nothin girl? Your man's still wrinkled
He called me "one hit wonder" as far as my singles
You can't be browned up when your boots albeeno
Albino, sorry I get saucy like Pringles
Skinny nigga dope well say I buy a kilo
My girl fly in bed, Red Bull give her wings though
Stand her up for 10 nights, bust on the same doe!

   <lyrics>
    [Intro]
Ha ha! Geah
Uhh.. ay.. New Boyz!
Ay uhh, ayy
Ay, ay, ay, ayy
I'm turnt up (I'm turnt up) {*3X*}
I'm turnt up, and I don't give a...

[Verse One: Legacy + Ben J]
I'm turnt up, what ye ain't know?
It's the young fly nigga from the three-one-oh
I rap, I jerk, and I have to steez
I'm makin things with this paper like I'm Japanese
Spit game so nasty no water could cleanse me
Like I'm so fly even swatters offend me
Rock a feel one time then I change like Obama
I'm gettin so cocky I'm a start rockin condoms; know what?

Hold up, let me show these hoes up
I'm so turnt up I'm talking backwards like Yoda
And my words kinda slur but I still got game
Aw you got a pre-paid? Well I still got AIM
Just got a new kick and I keep it with me
It's I, Ben Jammin, and the E is a favorite
I'ma keep it in my pocket 'fore it end up gone
Cause I'm too turnt up bitch sing my song

[Chorus]
I'm turnt up, I'm I'm turnt up
Just lost my phone and dropped my cup
They stole my whip and now I'm stuck
But as long as this bump, I'ma still go dumb
Like I'm turnt up (I'm turnt up) hey I'm turnt up (I'm turnt up)
Like I'm turnt up (I'm turnt up) I'm turnt, I'm I'm turnt up

[Verse Two: Ben J + Legacy]
I'm turnt up, yup! Just as much as I wanna be
Goin so dumb that the nerds makin fun of me
These girls dancin on me but they really wasn't wantin me
Until I said, I'm Ben J, then they cornered me
"Like OMG! Do you know who you are?"
I said "I don't even 'member where I parked my car"
She was like "Can you jerk? I know that you ain't afraid"
I said "I'm too turnt up, I just do the Ben J"

Like left leg out, right leg out
You feelin gone girl? I can take you to my house
The stairs top high? We can get up on my couch
See clothes off? Damn we can get it on right now
I was like "You got a rubber?" She was like "Uhh, no
but we can still do it" I was like "Uhh, no!"
But it's kinda late girl I think you gotta go
She yelled at me (YOU'RE A JERK) and I said "I know!"

[Chorus]

[Verse Three: New Boyz[]
I stained my shirt and scuffed my shoes
Don't know where I'm at and it's past curfew
I can't stop laughin and my friends think I'm dumb
These are the signs that I am turnt up
That I am TURNT UP {*6X*}
Yup!! These are the signs that I am turnt up

[Chorus]

    [Intro: Panchi]
Uh huh, uh!!!

[Verse One: Panchi]
Yo Preme look what happened when the game got sloppy
Introducin the Lone Ranger the kimosabe
The horse is the big gun, the ten gallon tracks
The hood cowboys with the ten gallon raps
Rockin ACG boots and baseball caps
I agree this ain't the symbolation of the do you
This the shit the shot sent to get used to
GangStarr Foundation the tree, we branched off
Shined eyes yes waited our chance to blast off
Year Round in possession of W-M-D's
Blaq Poet, Nick, Khaleel to NYG'z
I'm makin dollars out of pressure my pipe's are intact
Don't believe me, ask yo' bitch, boy - now back to the track
These recordings be important not responsible for drama
Of Sarah Palin, Joe Biden, McCain and Obama!!!

[Chorus 2X: Shabeeno] (DJ Premier Scratchin)
Man listen, we be on a life or death mission
Get paid like tuition, or caged up in prison
One time for ya mind two ghetto politicians
Three for all my niggas locked down in the system
(N! Y! G!)

[Verse Two: Shabeeno]
They say New York fell of, we'll bring the New York back
I'm like, "Where we went? What part of the game is that?"
We've been here the whole time nigga, anxiously waitin
In the streets paper chasin, Preme testin our patience
Now stop the presses, listen up this is not a lecture
More like a message with a flow that's as hot as peppers
Pop then kill 'em, only way you can stop this villian
I'm sick wit it, couldn't kill me with amoxicillin
I've been the illest since Ill Kid Operation Rat'
The suicide though, I never contemplated that
Then that's a wrap, turn your pages to '03
Chapter NYG'Z, Panch' is my co-deed{?}
No "I" in team homie, picture me solo
Seen what happened to Tony? What he did to Manolo?
There go that New York Giant, back on his shit again
Seen with +Wolverines+ and they wasn't from Michigan
Y'all niggas listenin? Y'all can hear a lyrical
street pharmacist, my cottage rawer than {?}
Rap shit don't work find us, in Tennesee
Lookin for bucks, seein if they still ten-a-key

[Bridge: DJ Premier]
N! Y! G!
W-W-We appeal, to those that's real ("Heather B")
Pr-Pract-Practice freedom of speech and refuse to hold back
Mo-Mo-M-Motherfuck!!! What you say!!!

    Been So Long
   </title>
   <lyrics>
    * bonus track from the deluxe edition titled "More Pigface Weapon Waist"

[Intro: Crooked I]
It's been so long since
Hip-Hop spoke to the problems of the world
Somethin's goin on
It's like a conspiracy, to stop us

[Crooked I]
Yo, nobody knows what goes on inside of me
So this time I'm rhymin out of my diary
See I ain't scared of society and Bill O'Reilly
Get tyranny, could never silence or either quiet me
I'm watchin every step you make, every breath you take
I'm thinkin F you snakes
I'm focused on the future, I wonder 'bout my nephew's fate
Probably worse than FEMA's Katrina rescue rate
And I ain't talkin Crip or Blood when I say red-blue state
I mean Democrats and Repub's, best educate
yourself, cause the drama's real
And Fox News Corporation want Obama killed; keep it trill
Barack gettin hated on by right-wing extremists
You're hatin on yourself cause he's half-white you genius
You're damn right, and Glenn Beck you redneck asswipe
You're presently a dick and in your past life a penis!
I mean it, yeah

[Chorus: Sally Anthony]
And I know that something is going on
(Going on and on)
Cause we haven't spoken for so long
It's been so long

[Crooked I - over Chorus]
Somethin's goin on, yeah
I put it in a song
Been a long time
Since we did it like, this

[Crooked I]
Dear Mr. President it's time to cut your charm off
Reachin across the aisle to those who will cut your arm off
The topic of public options set the alarm off
Look at the town halls, that was they downfall
They was supposed to be discussin health insurance but they wasn't
They was cussin, "Hang that nigga by his brown balls!"
I heard 'em screamin, and I believe in freedom of speech
But I also believe in treason so what's the reason?
The people in Texas are stressin succession? Answer that question
The answer his complexion, it ain't perplexin (naw)
They never wanted to see a black man move America in the right direction
Stop the war and fight recession
I represent for my citizens who don't have a chance
Can't afford a dental plan or a ride in an ambulance
For my soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan
Hope you don't get tortured by the Taliban
Cause the waterboardin, is so important, man!

[Chorus] - begins over last line

[Crooked I - over Chorus]
Yo! Somethin's goin on!
Open your eyes!
Somethin's goin on
They don't want us talkin about the real
We haven't talked about it in so long
It's been a long time

[Sally] Can I ask you somethin?
[Crook] Chea..
[Sally] Have you changed or are you the same?
[Crook] Let me know {*echoes*}

Now lawdy lawdy lawdy (lawdy) please Lord have some mercy (mercy)

See she went front to back (back) then she went side to side (side)
I'm throwing blanky jankies (jankies) I think I need a ride (ride)
One pocket full of pills (pills) and a little bag of that cola (cola)
The other one full of weed (weed) and a semi auto pistol-a (tol-a)
See I ain't no dancin dude (dude) but I can lean like a cholo (cholo)

[Chorus]

[Verse Two]
They call me the Juice when I'm at strip club

Cause when I leave the club I'ma fu-uh-uh-uhhhck
You can ride with the mayne if he givin up the brain
Little scared to ride wit'cha I don't even know your name
There's a whole lotta room in the front of the Range

Pull over on the roll on the back seat (back seat)
Pop that body now you got me (got me)
You a fine chick kinda classy (classy)
Said her name was Ten now I'm grabbin (grabbin)
Cuz she got grip on the whip
With her big round booty with the silicone tits
Shit she bouncin on my lap and she tryin to own six
I whispered in her ear "Yeah +It's Hard For a Pimp+"

[Chorus]

[Verse Three]
All my ladies with a body, put yo' hands in the URR
Youse a good lookin hottie, put yo' hands in the URR

Shorty hot, watch her rock, let me see that lolli pop
Body rock, don't you stop, I love the way that booty drop
Sideways, front back, up and down I like that
Cherry lolli, chocolate lolli, I wanna see you pop that lolli

    Cold Places
   </title>
   <lyrics>
    [Chorus]
To all my people goin through it on a daily basis
And it seem like the world is full of cold places
Keep yo' head up, fuck what they said cause
you can do it and the man will get you through it
I believe that, homey I believe that
If I can picture that, I'll bring a picture back

[Ice Cube]
They say "Gangster, gangster! Tell me how you do it
How you get through it and them other niggaz blew it"
I keep my eye on the prize then pursue it
Chase it like a cheetah chuck it out and subdue it
So self-educate, nigga don't hate
Cause the game I got, is Madden oh-eight
Fuck with Cube, I'm better than YouTube
Fuck with them dudes them niggaz is new school
The game don't change just the players
The rhymes don't change just the fuckin rhymesayers
(Hahahaha!) They make it up as they go along
But I'm goin on 25 years strong
The shit I say might get you through the day
Or change your whole life, in a major way
The shit they say, might catch you a case
The shit I say, feel like your birthday

[Chorus]

[Ice Cube]
You know what? Momma said it'd be days like this
Straight hell on earth, but come up out the abyss
She said "Don't let 'em see you crawl, don't let 'em see you fall
All they wanna do is laugh when you tear your drawers"
It's a cold world nigga bring a bomber jacket
If it's another hustle out there I'ma crack it
Fuck the new dance I'ma learn how to eat
Get my mind right, stay up out these fuckin streets
They keep callin me
They keep callin, all the lil' homies keep fallin
In them same traps niggaz cain't figure out
In the fast lane boy but the bridge is out
Make my blood boil, get yo' life spoiled
Get you in the system, get you in the soil
And your funeral was sponsored by Unocal
Saw you UVN, nigga digital

[Chorus]

[Ice Cube]
I know, it's fucked up how they do us
Pretend they really care, but then they Jerry Lewis
Take that money that was allocated to us
Put us in some fucked up trailers then sue us
Watchin Katrina, is worser than Ike &amp; Tina
See New Orleans get bitchslapped by FEMA
Louisiana got racist-ass politics
Free the Jena Six (NIGGA FREE THE JENA SIX~!)
Your honor, Osama, Obama
Even, yo' momma, ain't fuckin with my comments
They want us to quit, forget
And not give a shit about these sick-ass politics
A lunatic is in the White House
Make me wanna go do a lick right now
But they'll make a nigga bow down
in the penitentiary, a billion dollar industry

[Chorus]

[Ice Cube]
I believe that, homey I believe that
If I can picture that, I'll bring a picture back

    Stir of Echoes (Remix)
   </title>
   <lyrics>
    (Intro)
T.H.U.G. Angelz, drink up brother
Heaven Razah
After you drink this you won't be thirsty again
Sometimes they ask me
Yo how the hell do you come up with the shit you come up with when you writing songs?
And I tell 'em

(Chorus) 2x
My mind is not here
My soul it travels in air
Is that more voices I hear?
Their souls they crying I'm clear

[Hell Razah]
Thug Angelical aura, use the metaphor to light the menorah
Louis V. on this yarmulke, I open the Torah
Me and Seraphim was sent in to slaughter Gomorrah
Pop two out the four corner in ya fedora
It's Amun Ra at the Mardi Gras
But gave my body to Yah Shabbat Shalom
To the brothers Rabat
And all my homies on lock 23/in the box
With an ox hitting the under the crotch
Or got one in the qaad
Since daycare was running they blocks
With a blood-clot, robocop with one arm
Log on to my www dot doctor dot com
Hear the songs of the future in digital form
Where cyber adultery or virtual porn
Another dead man walking, and criminal's born
Newlywed's on their honeymoon, the children's is mourn
You've been warned on YouTube and given the jewels
Come and build with a carpenter that's fixing the screws
Halliburton is emerging more prison with schools
The FDA got a serpent that be serving us food
We've been fooled by Obama, just look at ya grandmama
Same snake in the garden became an anaconda
Been reborn like Malcolm when he took his Shahada
They bow down and they honor to my lyrical Ka'ba
I tell 'em "Thou shalt not worship anything but the Father"
But worship my lyrics
Yo Razah? Yo Razah man?
I tell 'em "Thou shalt not worship anything but the Father"

(Chorus) 2x

[Atari Blitzkrieg]
The most exquisite of visions
Listen to the wisdom whispered to children
Buildings written by the architect embarking on missions
Ticking time rely on lines that lie on pyres conceived
I see the fauna on horizons hiding angels who bleed
Leave ... me behind when our alignment will shift
T trip to welcome in Aquarius by burying gifts
I rip the pages out the binding tied together with flaws
That cause the trauma from assumption when the Spaniards applause
Pause ... take a second to recover to your life
I won't deny that suicide has crept inside me at night
The light inside me burning turning earnings ashen
I'm searching first in doctrines hurting pockets my deposits returning
Worth emerging through the persons perching high on the ledge
To pledge through Vishnu true arrivals, might those belly's be fed
The dead are waiting, the voices calling, networks are crippled
Ripples through the planet damning man to trivial issues

   <lyrics>
    [Intro/Chorus]
"Together baby.. together baby"
"Baby just you and me (just you and me) whoahhh"

[Ghostface Killah]
Yo, yo
Aiyyo it's Tone, crispy like a pair of headphones
Used to play the 280 party rec rooms
Now I play the big spots all in the city
Spread champagne, scopin out bitties
Pick one, thick one son with small titties
It really doesn't matter as long as she's pretty
Come here mami, dancin right beside me
Tommy Hilfiger cut, skin like Halle
She looked like she get it from her momma (momma)
That's right Michelle, I'm Obama (bama)
Or maybe she get it from Madonna (donna)
+Material Girl+ I still don ya (don ya)
Je-wels is for the girl if she do well
Knew she was dangerous, she rode me up too well
Her jelly roll shakin like she into the well
She wanna put my name on her new nails

[Chorus] - repeat 2X

[Ghostface Killah]
Yo, yo
Aiyyo I roll on bitches, like a skateboard
Got a few friends that give they cake to whores
Me that's a no-no, Starks take control of a chick
then I go deep like Tony Romo
Kick 'em right out and the day starts over
Where I don't stop drinkin and I can't stand sober
In the morning when I wake up I get up just to ill
TD Bank is what I do with the mills
Bracelets, Cuban neck is on chill
Polar bear ice, I stay dressed to kill
I found my thrill on Blueberry Hill
Hittin the haze, now I'm on stilts
I'm too high, stuggle like Precious (Precious)
Love doctor niggaz get the message
When it comes to baggin a chick, don't be impressive
I get girls, y'all fellas is desperate

[Chorus] - repeat 2X

[Ghostface Killah]
Yeah
Yeah, yo
Yo son tap that girl, excuse me miss
You gangster~! Far from a bougie chick
Love the way you talk, your jeans fit nice
Still a lil' hood in you, you just my type
Go 'head swallow that new roll, no disrespect
You front on me tonight I'ma bag me a new hoe
Spank that ass like a real papichulo
Picture me Neutron I sit you right on your culo

[Chorus] - repeat 2X

[Ghostface over Chorus]
That's right sexy lady
Come and have a seat baby
Come get a taste of this Patron and Nuvo
This that Jimmy Neutron baby
Your lipstick lookin all good put your lips on this baby
Come sip on this, aight?
Check it out, let's go

    Daddy Fat Sax
   </title>
   <lyrics>
    [Big Boi]
It is I, the B-I-G, the B-O-I
Me oh my, ears to the street and eyes to the sky
Kept my sights on the prize, wide open, door wide
like the thighs of a hooker spread, told the girl bye
I got bigger fish to fry, niggaz wish I would retire
Cause of the pressure I apply every time I bust a rhyme
None of the rest of ya are tryin, watch me stimulate the minds of the masses
while you niggaz kickin it like jackasses
And who you votin for, Republican or Democratic?
Don't say it doesn't matter cause that's how they stole the last one
Assassin's bullet might be waitin for Obama
Do you think they'll have a brother before Billy's baby mama?
C'mon!

[Chorus: scratches by DJ Cutmaster Swiff]
"Look at the way you look at me" - "Da-Daddy Fat Sax"
"In my Cadillac, six woofers and fo' amps"
"Look at the way you look at me" - "Da-Daddy Fat Sax"
"In my Cadillac, six woofers and fo' amps"
"Look at the way you look at me" - "Daddy Fat-Fat Sax"
"In my Cadillac, six woofers and fo' amps"
"Look at the way you look at me" - "Da-Da-Daddy Fat Sax"
"In my Cadillac, six woofers and fo' amps"

[Big Boi]
My daddy told me it was mine for the takin
A true gift from God, the stars aligned when they made me
Him and Rena's baby, their first born son
I'm Antwan AndrÃ© Patton, the only one
Bloodline of a champion with heart of the lion
I'm defyin all the laws like a caterpillar flyin
Way before my time and reside in the Dirty Dirty
where they still hangin nooses like we in the early '30s
Goddamn, you know who I am? {"Da-Daddy Fat Sax"}
Royal fam of Atlanta, Dungeon bitch you understand? (boy!)
This ain't what you want, let's be clear from the bungie
I write knockout songs, you spit punchlines for money

[Chorus]

[Big Boi]
With my ears to the streets and my eyes to the sky
I'm on another planet my nigga and you just fly
(Why?) Cause I'm {"Da-Da-Daddy Fat Sax"}
Take that motherfucker, take that!
With my ears to the streets and my eyes to the sky
I'm on another planet my nigga and you just fly
(Why? Cause he's Daddy Fat Sax)
Ridin off in the Cadillac like that nigga

[Chorus]

[Big Boi]
Yea {"Da-Da-Daddy Fat Sax"}
What his name is? {"Da-Da-Daddy Fat Sax"}
What ya talkin 'bout? {"Da-Da-Daddy Fat Sax"}
Boy stop!

   <lyrics>
    [Childish Gambino]
Is it really that bad that my clothes is tight?
That I hydrate babes like Pedialyte
That I stay rock hard like a meteorite
Thought your homeboy here was an idiot right?
Welllll you thought wrong, I got flavor
I rock shows with the blue light sabre
I hit dimes but also date eighters
I make moves, blow up like Al'Qaeda
I'm in kicks that you can't buy yet
Your kicks okay like your name Wyatt
Care Bear clockers, pink highlighters
Haters wanna snack my heat like firefighters
Boys out there think they're just like me
Naw naw, y'all funny, y'all from UCB?
Y'all standin in line, I'm in V.I.P.
Y'all know shit 'bout me like T.I.P., hah!

[Chorus]
{*skatting and harmonizing*}

[mc chris]
You think your voice is funny man? That's kind of hilarious
I'm the rapper makin money when the shadow in your area
I'm like a damager cause I'm a little loquacious
I do it for the hotties with the bodies bodacious
I'm high pitched, might flip you diss my node
Think chris ain't the shit, you can kiss my chode
Kick your ass, sales not too early to boast
Seriously bro, hand over the security code
Because my rhymes so fresh, green grocers' gotta spray 'em
Fired all my lawyers cause I didn't wanna pay 'em
From the P.M. to the A.M. I'll slay 'em with the sawed-off
Make a little money and I'll smoke the marijuana
mc without Glover is Matubb without Wigs
Jammin peed the bottle with the grocer on her kids
If one smokes Khan, the other smokes Mids
Let's mix it up a little like the DJ did
Bacardi and Coke, black and white cookie
Smokin in the alley cause you know we're playin hookie
and we're up to no good, please don't tell our mommas
Democrist is the dutch, cause we got this for Obama

[Chorus]

[Childish Gambino]
Sick of the Old Yeller, money like bank tellers
The chicks that I'm with are thicker thank Nutella
Y'all need to switch quick and get with a slick fella
Cause I'm bout to go Rihanna like I'm an umbrella
Come over to my place, we can cut like shears
And make some mistakes like Jamie Lynn Spears
I'm nasty? No - forward? Yes
I'm hip to the game, you're a rook like chess
My money so long that they call it John Silver's
Your money so light that it float like pillows
Oopsy, killers, you can see
Cause they close up shop when the clerks see me
I'm not Kanye, but my collar's popped
Cause the bro's like soda, I shit you not
This shit's bright orange, Fanta shade
You got the yellow face, that's my lemonade
I'mma try to stay tight like girls that fuck hard
And stay in the Bay with green like Brett Farve
{*four bars of silence*}

[Chorus] - to end

    Smack Muzik
   </title>
   <lyrics>
    [Sean Price]
Listen, rap to the beat, ya'll niggas can't rap to the beat
Clap at ya fleet, leave ya niggas flat in the streets
Smashing your peeps, whole fucking faculty meet
Ahead of my time, rhymes'll come back in a week
Smack Muzik, that gat in ya lap music
That North Cakillac, with crack in the 'lac music
Act stupid like niggas in special ed
Your ass'll get left for dead when I sketch yo head
Bent some bread, better than any nigga you know
Sean Price get nice like Henny, Remy and 'Dro
If inni, minni and moe, try to fuck up my flow then
I whip my gun, the semi ready to blow
Smash ya face, skinny pimp, smash ya tape
It's hard out there for a pimp, ask Pastor Mase
Listen, I rap wild but the cash is great
You? You rap mild but ya cash is late
Ya'll niggas wack like black in alley
My niggas trapped, see the mack I carry?
Hah, listen, when I kill 'em, I kill 'em in cold blood
I ain't playing with none of these niggas, let it go, Flood

[Chorus: Flood]
Uh, ya'll niggas don't want no drama
In ya house, talking to ya mama, quit
Put niggas on Slim Fast, that's a lead type
You want it with him? Huh, go ahead try it
Ya'll niggas ain't built like that
Ya'll niggas ain't been like that, where you been at, black?
P, eat them niggas, feel that track
Let 'em know, where Brooklyn at? What the fuck, we right here, nigga

[Rock]
Listen, this Smack Muzik, you sucka ass niggas get smacked to it
For no particular reason, just cuz you rap stupid
Or maybe just cuz it's heated, niggas react to it
End of Pulp Fiction, you lucky you ain't get clapped too
Welcome to my animal house, or should I say the cannibal house
We moved out the animals out, damn it, we foul
Cannons about, as big as your mother, we hit you, you done
I don't mean like dunn-dunn, dumb ass, your for 'em
Son, these ain't real niggas, I smell bird
They a bunch of bitches that like bitches, they L Word
Impersonators, I heard a hater, they a tell word
Wanna send me to jail, I'mma send them to hell, first
Terrorize you like my name Osama
I'm not, I'm hardcore President Big Rock Obama
That's me, you third grade math, you are not no problem
Divide or subtract you niggas when the shots got blocka
I'm such a monster, appear and destroy and I'm up in God, chumps
Rest assure your boy is fucking bonkers
Just ball, like MJG, you don't want no drama
Monster, never seen one? I can show ya
No deep cars, but I'm a Rock N Rolla
Let's roll, I drive you crazy, I'm not chaffeur
You cannot hang, you not my posters, hit 'em Flood

    Nothin' Like a Slab
   </title>
   <lyrics>
    (*talking*)
Yeah it's that slab music nigga, that Texas shit
Whether you rolling a foreign, or you rolling a drop
24's or 84's, let's ride

[Hook - 2x]
Yeah we like them Bentleys, Porsches and Mclarens
Maseratis and them Rovers, got your eyes glaring
But I love to grab, when I'm swanging down the Ave.
In my candy coated old school, cause ain't nothing like a slab

[Chalie Boy]
I'm riding a curve, Ferrari in the gargae
8 Ball and 'JG screwed, Comin' Out Hard
Swanging down the boulevard, popped trunk it's an applause
My black superman slab screens, read above the law
Diesel and I'm present nixing, with the past look throwed
'79 Cutlass on twenty inch, 84 glass and vogues
Making boppers say whoa, haters holla fa sho
Slab motor is the truth, you need proof let's go
Pink slip please, hand me that key
My retail, is more than I paid for my new SUV
Got a 26 inch high, blue general Lee
His twin sister in the backyard, I eat your dinner for free

[Hook - 2x]

[Chalie Boy]
'79 Fleetwood, '09 Deville
Both got butter seats, both wood wheel
Both triple coated, and fully loaded they is
But my booshie broad like plastic, and my shorty like steel
Fly in my Lexus, it's quiet in my Audi
Top of my class, you hear my Charger and Magnum come loudly
My Silverado setting standards
But I'll shake it all up, in my old school Fred Sanford
Dropped down the Amber, Lamborghini'll spoil ya
But it's something, bout flipping a deuce and a quarter
30 inches, off of the ground
New whips looking nice, but my old school's holding it down

[Hook]

[Chalie Boy]
On my mama, on my hood
In my Delta '88, I look good
'78 Thunderbird, leatherd up with wood
'62 Shelby stang bang, will make you drop where you stood
I could, step out an Impala
High octane heavy metal make you flex, few holla
SS Camaro, growl like a rottweiler
My Biarritz a yankee big dog, Benz by the collar
Whip game proper, crush whatever thought you thinking
What's that smell, me and Obama in the Lincoln
El Camino Caprices, to Regals and them crown victs
Any car I show wherever I go, bet I clown it mayn

    So Cruel
   </title>
   <lyrics>
    [Saigon]
I'm the same kid that tried to murder your brother
Now I'm on the motherfucking murderdog cover
Act like a non believer go head
Act like you ain't read about a nigga in the don diva
It wasn't for my rhymes neither
It was about how I cock the gat shot a cat back in nine fever
Why the source gave me rhyme of the month
When I should have got the rhyme of modern day time
Fuck these niggas
I could be richer than Phil Drummond and still bumming
And I know the difference between a bitch and a real woman
Niggas stay up 25 hours a night
Any coward could write
They bark but they bite don't devour the mic
I am the wildest in sight
Been in the pen so I can tell you how it was like
I done seen bloods faces pouring it out
Six in the morning CO's yelling all in account
Now fuck that this not what the song is about
This is about you weak rap niggas thats out
And ya'll bitches in the crowd that wouldn't give us no rivul
When my shit pop I ain't gon give you no jizzle
Nothing but fuck yous and bad criticism
Obama is the pres but I voted for "?"
I'm the meaning of lyricism
If its somebody that feel different
Give him my digits
Tell him to hit'em
He can call me on the late night or early in the morn
And thats my word born we gon get it on
And I don't care if we don't get along
Cause ya'll niggas is cum
Ya'll niggas just ain't that strong


[Saigon]
I'm showing off with static it ain't only just now
I don't smoke cigs but i'll give you a bust down
Creep by wherever you hang and bust rounds
You gone hear the sound of the pound now
Thou shall not fuck with nor say B.I.G. rhyme
If you ain't one of the sean's the shits corn
Moving right along my name Saigon
The future of rap faggot the next icon
If I could just keep that gun in the house
Or for five fucking minutes stop running my mouth
Shit i'll be alright niggas ain't tight
They don't write the kind of rhymes that I write
Right right I'm lyrically five mic material
Nigga you love the rizzle
And I like to give it to you
So lets make things nice and clear
I'm shitting on the whole game twice a year
And they scared bitch

[Pitbull]
Mr. 305 (Yeah)
Omar Cruz (This is for the ladies)

Chorus: Pitbull (Omar Cruz)
I'll be in the club with some bad ones with me (Yeah)
And it's plain to see, I am where they wanna be (Oh, oh)
Anytime they see me, let me tell you what they ask (What they ask, Pit)
They ask "Where them hoes at, and where the booty at" (Let's go)

[Verse 1: Omar Cruz]
Yeah
Little mama, what it do
Love the way they move it up and down for Pit and Cruz
And you can keep sippin' the booze
I don't know how that booty takin' so much abuse
Ha
Weight droppin' on the floor
Man, not from Oakland, but tell me, "What it do"
40 Water told me
You already know
She a superfreak slash nympho
They know
They know
Quarter past four
Almost like a movie, movin' in slow-mo
If she got no booty, it's a no-go
We gon' take this back to the mo
Let's go
Don't stop
Shake it like that
I'm a make it purrier that little putty cat
Grooves with the fur, when I'm caught up with the strap
On the west, where they show y'all
Where the booty at

Repeat Chorus

Break: Omar Cruz
Uh, uh
Yeah, drop it on the floor
Uh, uh
Drop, drop it on the floor
Uh, uh
Yeah, drop it on the floor
Uh, uh, yeah
LET'S GO

[Verse 2: Pitbull]
Go 'head, little mama
Back that thang up
Standin' ovation
Clap that thang up
Two chicos, O.C., Pitbull
Straight G code, don't mess with no fools
I'm a dance go-go
And she bounce that
Thang like a six-four low-low, oh
From L.A., straight down to Coco's
Wanna act loco, foe, from the .44
My women
Off the chain
Your's Jermaine Dupri, you know, So So (So So...)
Soon as I touch down on the map
First thing I ask is "Where the booty at"

Repeat Chorus

Repeat Break

[Verse 3: Omar Cruz]
Yeah
You already know my team
That's why they salute me from here to NYC
Yeah
ATL messin' with me
Get love in H-Town, Pimp C, R.I.P.
Ah
And I'm only schoolin' bad mami
You got no booty love, baby, that's too bad mami
Haul in my face, booty spillin' the vodka
The rock pourin' from L.A. to Opa-Locka (Whoo!)
Yeah
She got it from her mama
She wanna meet the president, the Mexican Obama
Love when you move it like that
You with Pit and O. Cruz, you know where the booty at

Repeat Chorus

Repeat Break

    Trouble On My Mind
   </title>
   <lyrics>
    [Pusha T]
It's the blackout, 'rari got the back out
Showin my black ass, engine in the glass house
Started in the crack house, Obama went the back route
Kill Bin Laden, 'nother four up in the black house
Still got the Macs out, pull the mask down like a mascot
Still trick with bitches, out wit' money or wit' ass shots
G.O.O.D. had room for one more, I took the last spot
Re-Up Gang, P the nigga, 'Ye done hit the jackpot
Whole 'nother level
Then you add fame, that's a whole 'nother devil
Legit drug dealer, that's a whole 'nother bezel
The carbon Audemar, that's a whole 'nother metal, but still keep it ghetto
(WOO!) Behind the scenes, pull strings like Gepetto
The gun blow steam, whistle like a tea kettle
Runnin like the +Rebels+, UNLV
Sport shoe on a pedal, I let you niggaz settle, YAH!

[Chorus: Pusha T]
Trouble on my mind, I got trouble on my mind
Trouble on my mind, so much trouble on my mind
Trouble on my mind, I got trouble on my mind
Trouble on my mind, so much trouble on my mind

[Tyler, the Creator]
Pharrell said "Get 'em," so I got 'em
Tripped on Bristol Palin then I accidentally shot 'em
Then it ricocheted and killed the game, I'm a pro'lem
'cause I wanna fuck the world, but not a fan of usin condoms
Pardon my French, I'm going hard as my dick
when I envision my tip, on the crust of bitch lips
Mr. Lipschitz has been trippin, since I mentioned Reptar
Triceratops dinosaur dick
I feel it in my gut... to kill these motherfucks
is a must like the arm of my pits
You niggaz comin shorter than a Bushwick Billy costume
on sale during Christmas in Philly
I'm well, not really, it's gettin kinda chilly
Let's hit a couple bars and give some bitches wet willies
Soaked, +Gettin' Jiggy, with It+, in Bel-Air's richest
Wit' a bag of pills, couple berries and a biscuit

[Chorus]

[Tyler, the Creator]
I'm a fuckin walking paradox
and a really shitty rapper in my favorite pair of socks
Ironed pair of Dockers, two Glocks cocked screamin (WESTSIIIIIIDE~!!!)
wit' the speakers blastin a pair of Pacs'
"Yonkers" ten milli, you're silly
Thinkin that this 'preme wasn't free, willy (fuck you)
The feeling is neutral, the gang is youthful
and fuckin tighter than Chad Hugo's pupils
It's Wolf Gang and the..

[Pusha T]
with the Re-Up's a helluva buzz
Rick James said, "Cocaine's a helluva drug"
Who else could put the hipsters with felons and thugs
and paint a perfect picture of what sellin it does?
This is for the critics, who doubted the chemistry
Two different worlds, same symmetry
And this black art, see the wizardry
When you at the top of your game, you make enemies
You'll NEVER finish me

   <lyrics>
    * first single; send corrections to the typist

Louder, louder, louder, louder, louder, louder
louder, louder, Yeah
(Repeat)

Yeah, it's for the People

[Verse 1]
This is street ra-dio, for unsung heroes
Ridin in they regal, tryin to stay legal
My daughter found Nemo, I found the new primo
Yeah you know how we do, we do it for the people
And the struggles of the brothas and the folks
With lovers under dope, experiment to discover hopes
Scuffle for notes, the rougher I wrote, times were harder
Went from rocky starter to a voice of a martyr
Why white folks focus on dogs and yoga
While people on the low end tryin to ball and get over
Lyrics are like liquor for the fallen soldiers
From the bounce to the ounce, its all our culture
Everyday we hustlin, tryna get them custom rims
Law we ain't trustin them, thick broads we lust in them
Sick and tired of bunchin it, I look on the bus at them
When I see them struggling, I think how I'm touchin them
The People

[Chorus]
The day, has come
Now we, are one
Just take, your time
And then, you'll find

[Verse 2]
This is street ra-dio, for unsung heroes
Ridin in they regal, tryin to stay legal
My daughter found Nemo, I found the new primo
Yeah you know how we do, we do it for the people
The people said that I was sharp on TV
At the Grammy's, though they tried to India.Arie me
Got back stage, and I bumped into Stevie
He said no matter what, the people gone see me
Can't leave rap alone the streets need me
Hunger in they eyes, is what seems to feed me
Inside peace mixed with beast seem to breed me
Nobody believe, until I believe me
Now I'm on the rise doin business with my guys
Visions realize, music affected lives
A gift from the skies, to be recognize
I'm keeping my eyes on the people, that's the prize

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
This is street ra-dio, for unsung heroes
Ridin in they regal, tryin to stay legal
My daughter found Nemo, I found the new primo
Yeah you know how we do, we do it for the people
From Englewood to a single hood in Botswana
I see the I in We my nigga, yours is my drama
Standin in front of the judge with no honor
Barack stick, knight the people like Obama
The karma of the streets is needs and takes
Sometimes we find peace in beats and breaks
Put the bang in the back so the seats can shake
Rebel Cadillac music for the people sake
The People

   <lyrics>
    (Razah talking)
Rubiez, Renaissance, The Blacksmith
Established 1976, Heaven Razah

(Chorus) Razah
My revolutionaries dance wit a gun inside slums
Same jungles that the Panthers was from
Independent like 'Sanford and Son'
My heart beat the same drum my ancestors was from

Let me get into it like this

[Hell Razah]
You woke the best rapper 'Buried Alive'
You shoulda kept my name outta your mind
I ain't sign but by the time let's hit 'America Online'
I turn a chirp in time to tarnish your shine
You look airbrush, graphic design
I'm just a wisemen who happen to rhyme
It's just half of my time
You got a lot of cards, money and jewels
You know the rules
I got confident with nothing to lose
I'm old school from that 'Soul Train'
Cold train blues, spit that propane fuel
You an example of what cocaine do
Yeah I'm flammable, heard your two-bars that's pertaining to
Hell Razah sharpness that's sparking up your darkness
Battling my conscious, my rocket ship launches
I ain't off the meter neither
See I'm off the compass
When North, East, West, South feel me I accomplish
Smoke a rap star; roll 'em in the red carpet
And spark it then go reload the AK cartridge
Battle me, I be on some suicidal bomb shit
With C-4 nitrogen underneath the armpit
(Bazz: They ain't ready for you son)

(Interlude) Razah
Yeah, I turn words into a diamond when I start rhyming
The Blacksmith - The Blacksmith
I turn words into a diamond when I start rhyming
The Blacksmith
Razah Rubiez

[Hell Razah]
It's like Osama met Barack Obama and he sold out his honor
For a rocket launcher, I'm like the Loch Ness monster
I conquer; cop a tissue-like Hannibal
I'm wit you like Emmanuel
You wanna be a Renaissance Child? Get the manual
I'm coming for my royalties down to my mechanicals
Homey I was born a king since the Book of Samuel
Bring along your camera crew so they could see me damage you
Yeah, I spit a 16 Bar Mitzvah
That coulda fucked around and bombed Hitler
Moving the form of a shark's figure
Study my art like a dark picture
Notice the crosses of swastika
Now we raised around cop killers
Oh you a Blood? Here's a maxi-pad
Now go and flag down a taxi cab
You in the wrath of my aftermath
Like Dead President's burnt cash
It ain't confirmed till it's Ur ash...

That's the word from The Blacksmith

(Chorus) Razah
My revolutionaries dance wit a gun inside slums
Same jungles that the Panthers was from
Independent like 'Sanford and Son'
My heart beat the same drum my ancestors was from
Bang my anthem in the Black Phantom
Controversial so they work the bandom
They get ugly but the verse's handsome
They get ugly but the verse's handsome

    Hood Symphony
   </title>
   <lyrics>
    (Hook) 2x
My hood symphony, let's make a musical
Ya haters is nothing but spectators, just the usual
I hold the mic gun powder on the cubicles
Let off couple shots and the murder is looking beautiful

[Chief Kamachi]
I'm on some cool shit, call it the wrath of chill
I feel like strolling thru a garden picking daffodils
Nothing you craft is ill, weak linguistic process
I graduated, heavenly sedated on the top test
Swimming in the swamp looking for the Loch Ness
Came a long way still got the hammers in a lock chest
Backed out, bail papers seating on the cop desk
Cuz I don't rap about crap, the label say I'm not fresh
I've been to France, Barcelona, Oslo
Couple of other countries where my fans keep my eyes low
How you like me now? I contradict their theories
I've been around the globe twice without a hitch they hear me
Mach been doing this for years, the name is now embedded
And the underground love me cuz they now I come to set it
Got the sword of righteousness and all the devils get beheaded
Tryna pay their way in heaven hope the angels taking credit

(Hook) 2x

[Chief Kamachi]
Rebel Without a Pause, trapped behind the walls
Watch the belly of the beast
Don't get snapped up in they jaws
I don't care if you a Moor, they ain't practicing they laws
Got your mind inside a coma, keep you wrapped up in the ghouls
Can never find a bookstore when shopping at the malls
They don't want us to discover all the fallacies and flaws
When the news first broke, Obama was a president
I sat, starred at the TV, motionless, unventilated
I came here as slave, never felt like a resident
Do I believe in miracles? They saying that he heaven sent
The world is in a different space
But I can't pick and choose
More than a thousand good reasons for conflicting views
Turn to channel 7, we watching different news
Find the truth from allegory and some cryptic clues
Fascinated with masonry and some mystic Jews
Over the burning hot sands and expensive shoes

(Hook) 2x

[Chief Kamachi]
I studied everything, voodoo curses to five-percent
I know some broke know-it-alls chilling in the squalor bench
They quoting books know all the schools where the scholars went
But every month they a quarter short on their dollar rent
Welcome to my parliament, feel like the hardest sent
Let's raise our babies, treat our ladies like our fathers meant
I'm talking kings and queens, you talking crap and cook
I understand nigga remember that I'm half a crook
I never swore on the Bible I just passed the book
And had a smile on my face when the pastor looked
Seven days all the time that the Master took
Another classic rap album nigga blast the hook
Play with the instruments, make violent incidents
My aura red, you're dead, not a coincidence
It ain't no sympathy you looking for some sentiments
Your last supper and you're sitting at the dinner tense

    [Nelly]
Life... what is it for real?

[Ali]
I don't know... yo
It's like hate takin over but hold up, what is it over?
Suicide, man that's the devil tryin to control us
They told us but we ain't notice the pain was sittin on they shoulders
The world is just too polar, they'd rather live in the solar
System got us hopeless, they focus on foreclosures
Wake up and smell the Folgers, Obama bring home the soldiers
Osama, you owe us, the 9/11 was bogus
Now we right back at him, save the world is our motive
C'mon...

[Nelly]
Yeah, wake up early in the streets of the block (streets of the block)
He posted up on the corner like a soldier in a drill but it won't stop
Yeah, livin life in the battlefield (battlefield)
Hmm, tryin to survive every day and every night is the same deal
Cause, life's strange (life's strange) time changes (time changes)
But karma always finds a way
Stay strong (stay strong) hold on (hold on)
And don't let all your dreams fade away

[Interlude: Nelly]
Yeah life can beat you down
What goes, it comes around
It's not how you hit the ground
It's how fast you get back up, and

[Chorus: Nelly]
Go! Keep goin, sometimes it feel like I'm givin my life away
And it gets hard, and harder, the happiness is worth the wait
Cause all I want is a better day
Cause all I want is a better way, hey

[Nelly]
A lot of mothers they just don't understand (they just don't understand)
Yeah, they think we hard on our sons but we gotta teach our boys how to be a man
Yeah, they on they own when they walk out the door (when they walk out the door)
Mm, see we can show 'em how to fire but they gotta teach theyself how to reload
Cause, unemployment's higher than it's ever been
Sometimes it feels like I can't win
And even though all the rules keep changin
I'm stronger now than I was when I came in

[Interlude] + [Chorus]

[Talib Kweli]
Hey, hey
Rollin through the back streets like we got beef
A carnival for carnivores with the sharp teeth
They animalistic, that's why we call the cops beast
They on the hunt cause they hungry for the dark meat
I'm rappin to my heartbeat, the brain is the bass
The heart is the drum; give the drummer some
Promise of a better life is all I got to give
I ain't just tryin to survive, I'm tryin to live

[Nelly]
Cause all I want is a better way, hey
If you're not prepared the world can be so cold
All that you can do is your best and just hope (yeah)
In time the truth will show, just stick to what you know
Get a grip on somethin real, and never let it GOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!

[Chorus] - 2X

    [Sample]
Never never never

[Intro] [Kurupt talking]
Yeah, you know. There's some things you'll never be
Some things you'll never see
You understand me mane? Kurupt Young Gotti, MURS. Listen

[Verse One] [MURS]
Forever man
You'll never be better than MURS and 9th Wonder
Wanna welcome you to Neverland
He press play and my imagination run wild on your best day
You only got one style
We multi-task, we multi-faceted
You soak up my style then you try to repackage it
We mastered this, no rookie mistakes here
Something like a mixture between Tookie and Shakespeare
Classic composition man we killin' compositions
Catalog consistent, it's compellin' you to listen
True poetry, we do it how it's supposed to be
Cause right before I write it I imagine you quotin' me

[Kurupt]
Tabernacle, pterodactyl, apple kush plants
Medical shops, I go and sample kush plants
I'm the first, the worst to verse ocean
Water vibe, vibrant, verse surfin'
Little mama
No drama
Osama
Obama
She said I'ma
Do it to her proper
She ain't never lie
Come and bring it to your poppa
I movie roles, baby I'm up for Oscars
Kick the game like football and soccer
Lames get maimed, perpetrators get penetrated
I cock it, I pop it, don't knock it so stop it
I got it I lock it, rocket, copped oxes
For real
I got that NATO appeal
Too much game
Too much skill
I'm smashin'
If Snoop won't fuck Kim Kardashian I will off of film
Feelin' myself cause this is how I feel
I'm too real
I'm too trill
And y'all never (never)
Seen a guy like me
Or anybody fly like me
I Ray J hoes, don't say no more
Video tape 'em but stay behind the camera with doe
I gotta let you know
That y'all never, never

"Never"

[Kurupt talking]
She said, "Come over here with me." I said, "Bitch, I'm camera shy." Haha.

[Verse Two] [MURS]
We shut it down
West coast king shit
California swagger supreme
I mean this
Chuck and Dickie's you can't fuck with me
We got the best weed
Half a zip a buck fifty
I'm makin' money, havin' fun, doin' great shit
It's MURS and Kurupt, motherfucker could you hate this?
I'm Dodgered out, we rock the house
Smokin' on the front porch at my mama's house (let me hit that)
Come see me, we take life easy
The homie, fresh out, said he seen me on TV
That's what I do it for
This is for you and yours
We do it for the love
What the fuck you makin' music for?

[Kurupt talking]
What you do it for? What you makin' music for? Huh?
Cause you could never ever ever ever
Be nothin' like this. We don't sip on Cris
This indo blowin' mane ya dig? Kush or nothing. Ya bitch!
Never. Aye MURS. I'm gonna see you at the festival mane

    [Intro]
Ha! This dem Ferrari Boyz - catch up!
BURR! Catch up! Catch up!

[Gucci Mane]
She stoned, she stoned, she gone off that Patron
I gave that bitch a hundred dollars just to leave me 'lone
Tell the waitress bring mo' bottles up cause she can keep the chaser
Lil' momma switchin by my section she want me to chase her (NOPE)
Wasted on moscato, but I'm losin my patience
I'm tellin her come go with me but all her homegirls hatin (FUCK 'EM)
Like Fred Flintstone, I'm a rolling stone (STONE)
My best friend is Barney so you know I'm rollin strong (STRONG)
Shawty in the zone, dress with the thong
Every nigga in the club tryin to take her home (GUCCI)
Shawty in the zone, dress with the thong
And every player in the club tryin to take her home (Gucci)

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
Ay let's get stoned (stoned) I'm so stoned
Like Fred Flintstone, I got a partner named Barney
and he keep me in the zone, the whole club stoned
The whole world stoned, and tonight we 'bout to party
like we just came home; ay let's get stoned (stoned)
Like Fred Flintstone, I got a partner named Barney
and he keep me in the zone, the whole club stoned
The whole world stoned, tonight we 'bout to party like we just came home

[Waka Flocka Flame]
Put your blunts in air, hookahs in the air
Put your lighter in the air if you tryin to get stoned
Tonight I'm puttin on, I swear to God I'll survive
Bitch I am that high~! Yes I am stoned
Drinkin on Obama, it's rainin white liquor
Gucci pass the dutches, I don't do no Swishers
Rock yellow stones, rock red stones
Bitch my money long, poppin pills and blowin strong
I'm a 'Stone Cold' flexer, Steve Austin +stunner+
Every concert man I'm gone (flex) stoned
In my zone hater leave me alone, be gone
Bird chains in the air - screamin as I yell

[Chorus]

[Waka Flocka Flame]
When you hear this song
The crowd gon' be jumpin up and down
Screamin I'm stoned! (I'm stoned!)
White Remy Martin can't drink Patron
Lost my keys I can't even make it home

[Gucci Mane]
E'rybody in here gone, all my homeboys stoned
My dogs just came home, ball like the Georgia Dome
Thinkin - it's back on, drinkin - that there Patron
It's over, I'm loaded, we toasted, we grown

    Gingerbread Man
   </title>
   <lyrics>
    [Intro]
It's Mannie mane, and Juicy mane, and Gucci Mane {*echoes*}

[Gucci Mane]
I'ma keep droppin verses, hotter than the hottest summer
Eat rappers like Jeffrey Dahmer, dope color Sinead O'Connor
Should I name another woman, rushin like President Obama
Warner Bros., two extra commas, all my shoes are Ferragamo
Lightnin actually hear the thunder, even Stevie Wonder wonder
why yo' baby momma called so much I had to change my number
Sarcassm, these bitches need to ride on while I pass 'em
I wouldn't even give that bitch an orgasm
Miraculously, my niggaz stand beside and not in back of me
So disrespect my faculty, how dare you have audacity?
The club packed to capacity, I cash out automatically
I spit these rhymes so radically, sporadically, fatality

[Chorus]
I got the green, drank, pills, blow
Runnin 'round the town gettin money I suppose
I'm the gingerbread man {*4X*}
I got the green, drank, pills, blow
I cain't get enough sleep, cause fiends be knockin on my do'
I'm the gingerbread man {*4X*}

[OJ Da Juiceman]
Gingerbread Man, I got white, I got white
Trap house, money up all night, take flight
Droppin ten bases, it's jumpin that white
Trees to that paper so I'm something like a kite
Loud stanky kush, at the end it need a light
Extra loud diamonds and it's lookin like a light
Rollin stay in money and my pockets just glide
Arrogant-ass diamonds cause they don't like to hide
VVS like glass so you block your eyes
These burnt color diamonds like a sweet potato pie
This the color diamonds and they ratchet like a fire
The brick man, the bread man, I don't tell no lies

[Chorus]

[Gucci Mane]
I'm the man that get it in, I ain't only in it to win
I am constantly settin a trend, I get bored and do it again
If I was ever was to cross the genie, I'd ask her for a twin
Cause the number of times that'd pay for me to get up off my end
It's 15 minutes to 10, ay and I'm done drinkin gin
Have to act like we were friends, but I don't like to pretend
I got 30 stacks, meet Ajax, get your freezer price on my album acts
I'm addicted to ballin, I hit Lind's mall and relapse
Your slump-ass no bankroll, my stacks gettin way too fat
No push up, just cook up, I'm booked up, I don't run laps
It's Mannie mane, and Gucci Mane, and Gucci Mane hold bricks mane
Got chips all in my britches so my house smell like cocaine

[Chorus]

    I Run

   <lyrics>
    [Intro: Slim Thug]
Geyeah
Slim Thugga
Boss Hogg Outlawz, Jim Jonsin, ha
Representin this Texas mayne
Back

[Chorus: set to A Flock of Seagulls "I Ran"]
I run, the streets all night and day (the hood love Thug)
Cause I still run, the streets all night and day
(If you tryin to find me)
(I rep for my city, go hard for the hood)
(Still posted on the block, what's good?)
And I run, the streets all night and day (ha)
I can't stay away

[Slim Thug]
They don't make too many niggaz like me
Bonifide hustler, certified G
Still got that work if you got the right fee
You thankin shit fake? Well nigga come see
It's bigger than the jewels, it's bigger than the cars
It's bigger than the fact that we fuckin rap stars
The street niggaz know me, these boys got my contacts
Knowin any given minute I can come back
I put a bitch on I-10 and tell her run dat
Give her ten and tell her don't brang nuttin back
I'm still in the hood, I can't leave the streets
It's in my blood, I'm a thug 'til I be deceased

[Chorus]

[Slim Thug]
It's hot on my block, somwbody turn the fan on
I've been paid, I'm just tryin to turn my mans on
And get my bread strong, streets miss me when I'm gone
I "Put On" for my city like Jeezy's song
Please believe me homes; matter fact check my stats
I ain't drop in three years, but I'm back
Where the money at? That's the first question
You better pack a strap; that's the first lesson
Hard times got the whole United States stressin
I'm writin a book - "How to Survive in a Recession"
Mr. Obama, we so tired of sellin crack
If you lookin for me ask the streets where I'm at

[Chorus]

[Slim Thug]
It's home sweet home where the D-boys roam
Movin stone for stone, or zone for zone
All night gettin it on 'til 6 in the morn'
The shit I'm smokin on, stronger then cologne
You can probably smell the smoke through your headphones
If you still broke better get your bread long
Call me on that burner cause them feds on my phone
And I'ma run the streets 'til I'm under my headstone

[Chorus]

    [Intro: Killah Priest]
Ugh, it's Priesthood, Mackavengelo

[Killah Priest]
I spit revolutionary, ready to shoot and bury
Presidents, we predicates to the fullest
Speak to forfeit, if you a shooter, come where the wolves is
Birds will seek from out the war ridge
Che Guevara, I spray whoever, mega
Prophecies, I drop sixteens, that you can watch on screens
It's Mackavangelo, flames and the candles will blow
From the garment, of the God sent, jewels the size of comets
I spit wizardry, with imagery
Of a Panaview film, I take your through realms
From 3D to 4D...

[Copywrite]
From shot foes, from mouth closed, with they in they drunk out mode
Whether I can brawl or not, never punk out though
So come to one of our shows, see we don't waste any time
I go straight to the Mike, like the Punch-Out code
You're a conscious rapper, you'll be an unconscious rapper
Unless I'm unconscious after all the rum vodka Snapple's
I'm the one, God, I'm asking, why me?
Never mind, I already know what the others won't get it
Til I'm in heaven, so
Many reverends told sinners where they headed tho
They're not God, so like a yes man, you'll never know
Oh, they wanna guess things, without facts
Passing judgments like your honor's breath stinks
Your mistake, I meant to bomb these fuckers
If there's any fucking doubt like Gwen Stefani's drummer
And I'm into comedy, brother
YouTube the video, you gotta feel it
So you could witness the fly up close on screen like Obama killed it

[Jakki Da Motamouth]
Your wife embrace her for a lab, she said she wanna see through
So I went straight for the ass and gave her the crabs
You faithful and mad, wanna fight me, here we go
I take Life like I stole Mikey cereal
I'm buying all you sell-outs, the hell out
When I stay behind you, but I just raised the bar like I'm the father
of an ale house
You hot clones, but you not known, you try to diss
I talk to God obtain the deed to your life, you got owned
And your bitch she got boned cuz she goofy
Ask me to buy a drink, so I bought her a round of roofies
If that ain't raw enough, I was war when I stuck gucci guns
And talk tough, I'm suppose to think you hard as fuck?
Go ahead and pull, God, see on Earth your laws do not apply to me
So go ahead and shoot me in the head and you'll die
Call me out, you won't hear Rah rule
Listen to your pupils ejaculate, here I come

    State of You
   </title>
   <lyrics>
    * samples are from Frou Frou's "Psychobabble"

[Chorus: Frou Frou sample]
If you think that it's so damn easy
Then what do you need me for?
Just look at the state of you
Babe, snap out of it
You're not listening to this

[Joe Budden]
Yeah... talk to 'em! Ohh
HUH? Joey!
It's, it's, that on top

Must be I'm just avoidin the inevitable, dodgin my fate
So many things a nigga gotta escape
Autobiographical, I need my life to maybe hop on a page
that'll end with a sigh, goodbye, with my mouth open cockin a gauge
How you the greatest at your job, but they dockin your pay?
Guess when God's holdin a bar they start mockin your ways
Murder my fans while I'm rockin on stage
Naw let me chill, I ain't thinkin at a logical state
I catch 'em while they noddin they head, sayin the words
And start a blood bath, right as they repeatin the verse
at the show let 'em know that they help lead to me bein disturbed
I'm thinkin {"You're not making any sense"} ha ha, listen (OHH!)
How much longer you expect me to be degraded
by niggaz who can't appreciate bein appreciated?
Y'all made this beef related
One less person to judge, just one more problem alleviated (HUH?)

[Chorus]

[Joe Budden]
Ya mean, uh, fruck's goin on?
Yeah! Listen

I'll stand before your honor, without a alibi, lost kinda
Just a product of a lost genre
Cuffed like I'ma cause drama, headline un-remorsed trauma
Sweat drippin from my head like I performed a concert
No alibi for my unlawful conduct
I need a pardon from the president, call Obama
And tell him I was goin all out
I was doin God's work, I thought the nigga called out

{"Snap out of it, you're not making any sense"}
They don't hear me, check it!

You lookin at a more honest improve in me
All of the comments and scutiny, drive him to lunacy
Committin hate crimes as if I got immunity
A opportune time to have opportunity
Not, but when he don't stop by it just ruins me
Pride is persuin me, why's it rebukin me?
I got demons by my door, staked out
I'm inside goin over my escape route

[Chorus] w/ Budden singing along

[Interlude: Frou Frou sample]
Now I've had it up to here
Don't ever try that again
Why are you so quiet so suddenly?
Go on, have it
You're just dying to tryyyyy me!

[Joe Budden]
Yeah, uh-huh-uh, uhh
Muh'frucker, uh, uh
Let me tell you

Yo, see I'm in search of privacy
On e'ry social network, but don't wan' network with society
That's, probably why my net worth ain't so high to me
These Percosets work, now they FUCKIN with my sobriety
I'm chasin a hit - all in Heath Ledge
+Dark Knight+ overdose, I ain't chasin the SHIT!
I got a audience, they just got me hatin this shit
Or is it how I view life, and how vacant it is
Watch me and see a horrible movie, bad reviews
Scattered views with a cold heart, wrong attitude
I ain't got a thing in common with these rapper dudes
Nigga! {"You're not making any sense"}
Okay, aside from some drawn-out thoughts, mags and tools
I don't think they know what it FEEL like to be battered, bruised
And still they can't see me with the ink
So try fuckin the world ain't as easy as you think, nigga!

[Chorus] + [Interlude]

[Outro: Joe Budden]
Oh, Joey! Ta-ha
Fruck's goin on?
You need me for?
Fuck them all niggaz, geah
The fruck's goin on?
Nigga! Ta-ha, yeah
It's, it's...
Warn yourself

    Hurt Me Soul
   </title>
   <lyrics>
    Now I ain't tryna be the greatest
I used to hate hip-hop... yup, because the women degraded
But Too $hort made me laugh, like a hypocrite I played it
A hypocrite I stated, though I only recited half
Omittin the word "bitch," cursin I wouldn't say it
Me and dog couldn't relate, til a bitch I dated
Forgive my favorite word for hers and hers alike
But I learnt it from a song I heard and sorta liked
Yeah, for the icin, glamorized drug dealin was appealin
But the block club kept it from in front of our buildin
Gangsta rap-based filmings became the buildin blocks
For children with leakin ceilings catchin drippins with pots
Coupled with compositions from Pac, Nas's "It Was Written"
In the mix with my realities and feelings
Living conditions, religion, ignorant wisdom and artistic vision
I began to jot, tap the world and listen, it drop

My mom can't feed me, my boyfriend beats me
I have sex for money, the hood don't love me
The cops wanna kill me, this nonsense built me
And I got noooo place to gooo
They bomb my village, they call us killers
Took me off they welfare, can't afford they health care
My teacher won't teach me, my master beats me
And it huuurts meee soooul

I had a ghetto boy bop, a Jay-Z boycott
'Cause he said that he never prayed to God, he prayed to Gotti
I'm thinkin golly, God guard me from the ungodly
But by my 30th watchin of "Streets is Watchin"
I was back to givin props again and that was botherin
Bout as uncomfortable as an untouchable touchin you
The theme songs that niggas hustle to seem wrong but these songs was comin true
And it was all becoming cool
I found a condom on the ground that Johns would cum into and thought
What constitutes a prostitute is the pursuit of profit then they drop it
The homie in a suit pat her on the butt, then rock it
It seems I was seein the same scene adopted
Prevalent in different things with the witnesses indifferent to stop it
They said don't knock it, mind ya business
His business isn't mine and that nigga pimpin got it

They took my daughter, we ain't got no water
I can't get hired, they cross on fire
We all got suspended, I just got sentenced
So I got noooo place to gooo
They threw down my gang sign, I ain't got no hang time
They talk about my sneakers, poisoned our leader
My father ain't seen me, turn off my TV
'Cause it huuurts meee soooul

So through the Grim Reaper sickle sharpening
Macintosh marketing
Oil field augering
Brazilian adolescent disarmament
Israeli occupation
Islamic martyrdom, precise
Yeah, laser guided targeting
Oil for food bartering, and terrorist organization harborin
Sand camouflage army men
CCF sponsorin, world conquerin, telephone monitorin
Louis Vuitton modelin, pornographic actress honorin
String theory ponderin, bulimic vomitin
Catholic priest fondlin, preemptive bombin and Osama and Obama and them
They breakin in my car again, deforestation and overloggin and
Hennessy and Hypnotic swallowin, hydroponic coughin and
All the world's ills, sittin on chrome 24-inch wheels, like that

They say I'm infected, this is why I injected
I had it aborted, we got deported
My laptop got spyware, they say that I can't lie here
But I got noooo place to gooo
I can't stop eatin, my best friend's leavin
My pastor touched me, I love this country
I lost my earpiece, I hope y'all hear me
'Cause it huuurts meee soooul

    Smilin' Faces
   </title>
   <lyrics>
    [Intro]
See I don't know what you've been told
Sooomebody told meee..
Never trust a man with a smiling face..
Just might be the day of life they take..

(ooOoooooooooo Oooooooooooo  Ooooooooo ooOOOoooo)

[Verse One: Kutt Calhoun]
This here be a letter from the heart, is anybody listen anymore
I dunno what where how when why, no trust anymore
Everyone got the same look, hard to decifer what's real
My little homie Layne just got tamed but he copped 5 with a deal
Does that really mean that he snitchin when he's smile tellin' me that it's official
Guess I'm ganna find out in his discovery, if it's game that was spittin'
Can't even trust my own girl, I done fucked up too much
Keep havin' dreams of her fuckin other niggaz, man it's just my luck
My old baby momma got it in for me when she tellin' me shits straight
Got a weird feelin' everytime I talk to her now we being taped
By some jealous ass bitch nigga thinkin' me and her in cahoots
Any given day and the federei speak no words when they shoot
This is what I deal with daily, ain't enough kills to lay me
Down to sleep I don't even trust a cheap life when you feel this crazy
That alone will decay me, lettin' all this realness fade me
Please look God, Heaven has a way let me see the real what's phazing?

[Chorus] (repeat x6)
What's that smile you wearing
What's that smile you weeaarr

[Verse Two: Kutt Calhoun]
Look at him plan as we speak, looking like the devil with a grin
Got it in for a building then can't wait to put it to an end
Hope Brock Obama got a plan, everybody waiting on you man
To get assassinated cause they all hatin' better be related to the clan
Hope you got a vest when it comes, Better yet a section of yard
Would be killaz who don't give a fuck sent to protect where you run (from)
Look at John Melville's state, think he had a smile when he aimed?
Shot and killed life was sealed, hit an old lady in the face
The world is full of monsters, you can see it hide behind the grin
Watch the movie there's a hidden message cause I think they all devil advocates
Even momma wish she on the drugs, different person when you give her hug
Everything you say and do is all official when you got the poison in your blood
Don't goto church that much, find out the weapons are bold
Get the money, get the whip, get the house and get the phills of the 12 year old
But they smile all in your face, and then they tell you the Lord is great
I just hope they all burn in hell when I bail with a smiling face

[Chorus]

[Verse Three: Kutt Calhoun]
Pac was a "Martin Luther King," died young cause he had a dream
To make it nessisary for each and every man and women to make amends
Told us all to smile through the madness, couldn't understand what he had then
Now I recognise he was prophesized angel in disguise in his passing
Don't know what this shit mean, Good and bad through the same thing
Till I know I'ma walk around with a Gun before I let the streets take me
Stress level at a new high, look around everybody a suspect
The man at the liquor store, the women at the mall, ain't nobody worth trustin'
Smiles every mother fucken where nigga go everybody ain't happy
Where the snakes at show the comment, why the jealous ones was the one to cap me
Keep smiling I keep brawling and I feel like ima catch an end soon
Before you get me, I'ma get you, don't visit me up in the pen fool
Cause you just gana come with a smile, sayin' everything's ok
When I know that's all just bullshit I'm never gana see the light of day
I'd rather just talk to myself, I swear to god it's better that way
Cause I feel ain't nobody real like I'm real, There, now I said it
Good day!

    Shotaz
   </title>
   <lyrics>
    [Intro, Skatterman]
Shotaz: the combination of a soldier and a boss
A nigga that refuse to take a short or a loss
So take a deep breath, today is your death day

[Chorus] 2X
You can call them shotaz
Move how we movin' or get you block (burnt)
Down to the ground we leavin' nada
No witness or survivors
No games, no playin', no words, no save

[Verse 1]
Kutt:
Break out your umbrellas niggas and your water-proofed vestses
It leaks bodies so eat hearty and finish your breakfastes
Cuz tonight we down in hell so go deliver the message
To your mommy father boy or daughter repent in your next of kin
In the still of the night calm waters'll shake
If you owe me money relatives come to honor your wake
Obituaries and rose wreaths to compliment faith
Only God can determine when your in a ominous state
Cuz when the rain drops niggas get wet
You gotsta chill or get popped and killed like EPMD is still in effect
You bleed for mercy with the steel in your neck
Once it verses gettin' worse you feelin' light-headed layin' still on your chest
An 80's baby with a killin' finesse
So fuck parole call up Makaveli with a concealed and carry a vest
You might make it through the alley but wont make it through the night
The ambulance wont understand that we got plans on sight

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Snug Brim:
Red bandana over these chop thangs
You can run tuck your tail holla lose your brains
It's all the same most of you bitchin' I can show you that
Make sure you got your catchers mitt cuz I'm a throw you that
You know where at, south side Kansas City
Missouri nigga we don't roll with nothin' less than fitty
You pussies call yourselves some riders but don't know the meanin'
Soon as a shot let off you're lost and you're duckin' and screamin'
You better move how I'm movin' or get your top seized
Make it hard for you to live I'm talkin' not breathe
If they catch me I'm a lay down like G's do
Silent mode, break the code and niggas bleed you
How can I please you, I roll with tecs and macs and glocks
You try to fake this way I pull up right up on your block
You see the shots sparks fly from the semi
Lay it down and go get gone on some Remy

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Snug Brim:
And I clap those, believe that
Y'all just some lil homies hustlin' for you weed sack
For these stacks aint no tellin' what I come across
I keep it real, play the game without a fuckin' flaw
Money talks so you ho niggas aint sayin' much
My pistol stay within the reach and I aint playin' brah
This rap shit is irrelavent, I got mail to get
Short on your nickels and dimes and I got hella clips

Kutt:
Shit and I got hella spit hit from a fast repitition
About an automatic rap and I handle the bidness
Give me a reason to proceed ram all the witness
Don't take no turkey talkin' steak from a sandwich nigga
About my cake but I aint ate cuz the candles are missin'
But on my momma like Obama I scramble for vision
So here today just consider me a man on a mission
Light up your porch like Mork from Ork nanu nanu you niggas

    We Must Be Heard
   </title>
   <lyrics>
    In the background [DJ Drama] This... Could be something big!

Verse One [Ludacris]
Don't change the station
I've been impatiently waiting
Pacin', welcome to the Danger Zone
It's a war goin' on outside
And my people gotta paint they faces on
And what I gotta do, And what I gotta do
Is work and flip a dolla'
Ain't got no trophies
But I got a shelf of empty liquor bottles

Not an alcoholic but alcohol it
Can ease the pain
Drinkin' all my problems away
But still prayin' in Jesus' name
Tryna' turn our voices up
And the government tones us down
Now that gas is goin' up
And the hood is goin' down

So the hood is comin' fo' ya'
In the streets is hungry goons!
Comin' to a neighborhood near you
Today or someday soon
Betta' watch yo' back, watch yo' front
And watch yo' side to side
Betta' grab yo' gat, light that blunt;
The streets gon' ride tonight

And I'm just gon' ride it out
Til my expiration date
'Cause I go hard and the paint [? ]
They softer than paper plates
Make way for the revolution
And yes you should be scurred
'Cause one way or another..
My people will be heard

Verse Two [Willie the Kid]
Show you what the soldiers see:
Embassy, Diplomacy
Since seen [? ] infantry
Shootin' at the cobra fleet [? ]
Deploy shots, similar to airbags, whereas
This hairpin, trigga' split a hair in half
Body bags, fish it [? ] like Harland [? ]
When I'm airin', tear a chair in half

Watchin' Half Baked
At the cabin by the Lake
See the blue and white plates
See the wood on the panel
I may be Chanel Oat, Chilly O, Flannel Coat [? ]
Warfare? Never fair
Therefore, I need finer things:
Like grenades; tanks; a couple fighter planes

I'm decorated in medals;
Stripes like a Zebra
And by the way, you rappin' Nigga's
I don't like you neitha'
I mean, "either, " proper gramma'
Pop a camera - man on that rap, DVD propaganda
Yeah, Willie the Kid, I ain't one for the shenanigans
Nigga' strike a pose, leave you froze, like a mannequin

Verse Three [Busta Rhymes]
(During Kid's last verse) In these times
The economy got nigga's thinkin'
The worst to make paper
'Cause somebody ain't accommodatin' nigga's
Enough for they slave labor
That's when ya' get a Nigga' thinkin about
Ya' know he gotta' come in to ya'
It's when a nigga' throw a ski mask on
Run up in ya' house, and wanna' do dumb shit to ya'

Rollin' the dices with a nigga' that be strugglin'
Tryna' make it through the crisis
It might just make him wanna' act up a little bit
To print another new gas prices
All this fuckery we got goin' on
Indeed it needs to cease
How the hell is THAT ever, ever gonna happen
When the value of the dollar keeps decreasin'?

Easin' my hand in somebody's pocket
(Fuck that!) I gotta' keep eatin
Speakin' for everybody in the struggle like me
We gotta get it even if we cheatin'!
Breathin' hard, my mind is blown
Tryin' not to get evicted out my home
But tryna' live when you know a nigga' broke
Is like tryna' squeeze blood out a stone

But I'm goin' through the drama with DJ Drama (What!?)
I do it for my kids and mama (Who!)
Leave it to Barack Obama (Yes!)
Change is right around the corna'
You tryin' to keep our people sufferin'
All I gotta say is if you don't ease up this pressure
I promise somebody gonna' pay!

Outro [DJ Drama]
(Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness!
Pursuit, huh?
See Each and every day we all get closer
To the real meanin'
Me, myself? I always follow my own path
And now I come here to motivate!
"To be heard" means to say something of value
So I make this my Life
My Liberty
And everday, my Pursuit
What about you?)

    Angels Demons
   </title>
   <lyrics>
    [Hook x2]
I got these angels on my shoulder
I got these angels on my shoulder
I got these angels on my shoulder
But these demons keep on talking and they're trying to win me over

[Verse 1]
See, I wake up with the voice in my head that says God's watching
Studied scriptures and even skimmed through Allah's doctrine
Minutes later I'm thinking of killing haters
And ways to bring in some paper so having faith is a hard option
My moms told me that praying will get me far in life
And anytime it gets hectic just give your heart to Christ
But I don't know if the Lord can help my bars get tight
Or make the fans think I'm a star that's nice, I'm an artist writing
Real shit, real feelings, angels in my ear
Like, "Do better, be better, pick a new career
Maybe teacher, preacher, counselor, physicist, engineer
Someone doing things with meaning for people" but then I hear
These demons with the horns like, "Rap, rhyme, spit it
Do a song with a dance, talk about the slutty bitches
Put half-naked chicks in the video, pour liquor
On they asses throw some stacks at the camera and yell, 'nigga, nigga, nigga
I'm ill, I'm getting it, fuck school'
Sell drugs, get a buzz, rock some shiny fake jewels"
But the angels come back screaming, "Make smart cool
Put depth in your music, reach the youngest, dumbest fools
While you kill it over beats and they sleeping, you break the rules
And have them thinking while they smoking and drinking and gripping tools"
And I choose the darkside
Sort of like Tre and Doughboy in that car ride
And then I shout "Dough let me out!" knowing that this is wrong
I'm conflicted in my life and in my songs
Y'all don't hear me, I'm knowing that this is wrong
I'm conflicted in my life and in my songs

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2]
Got me thinking bank robbery, Obama I need change
I envision car jacking this old man in the Range
Angels: "Work hard at your craft and deal with the pain
Everyday ain't always sunny, you want to just make it rain"
Demons: "Sha look at how long you been in the game
Ain't nobody trying to hear what you yapping, you sound lame
You ain't shooting, you ain't selling, you ain't balling you're the same
Dude rapping about your raps in your raps, then you complain"
Damn, but the angels start to whisper
"Wife up a queen," then the demons tell me dis her
The soldiers with the wings say lift brothers and sisters
But the creatures with the tails say get money consistent
Angels say, "God's son showed you the path"
Demons say, "The savior was hated until he passed
Sha you was born broke, parents called you accident
Jesus got gold and a holiday named after him"
Angels want me Christian or Catholic with wife and kids
Demons want me flipping bricks, getting clapped, or doing a bid
Angels: "Forget the whores and the groupies, the music biz"
Demons: "Thinking small, you'll never be Pac or Big stupid"

    Why (Remix)
   </title>
   <lyrics>
    [Intro - Anthony Hamilton]
All that I'm given
It's this pain that I'm living (The Remix, The Remix)
They got me in the system
Why they gotta do me like that

[Styles P]
Why is garbage music selling a lot
Why is the music industry state of mind real far from Hip Hop
Why vote republican if you black
Why build more jails, less schools cause we under attack
Why I keep the fo' pound in the air
The revolution will not be televised if around here
Why keep my right fist in the sky
I let them know that "We Gonna Make It," don't plan our demise
Why you gotta teach your kids on your own
Cuz when you get in the zone, they bringing you in, you both getting cloned
Why we still gotta pray to Allah
It's Hip Hop, this the New World Order and they playin us hard
Why rappers getting protection
Why the country ain't flipped when they jerked the votes the last election
Why die for all my beliefs
I gotta look at my kids I rather smile then cry when he's sleep
That's why

[Chorus - Anthony Hamilton]
Why
Why they got me strugglin, why
All the brothas caught behind bars
Drained up in the system going crazy
I'm battling my pistol going why

[Common]
Why do they say I changed for a girl
Why you worried bout my clothes if my flow gonna change the world
Why you wait till you 30 then try to be hard
Why I gotta have religion if I believe in God
Why is Bush acting like he trying to get Osama
Why don't we impeach him and elect Obama
Why ain't Rick James remembered for classic hits
Why do we remember Rick for smackin a bitch
Why did Ricky Williams retire, they mad at Miami
Why did Justin sell Janet out and go to the Grammy's
Why you kill on every song, why you frown at discriminance
So many thrones, why we argue who is the King
Why it's over for gangsta, why it's over for bling
Why they hype Britney up, they know she can't sing
Why a whip and a chain the black american dream
Why I know it in my heart it remains unseen
Why

[Chorus}

[Nas]
Registered voter not blood of a panther
Why is the question what is the answer
Got a suggestion, here's an example
Won't we build our own airline, states, and highways
Fly to Africa, do some trades with Zimbabwe
Why did Malcolm's mission die with the man
Why we ain't pick it up where he left it and carry out his plan
Why the merger try to exclude L.A. Reid
He brought you Usher, Outkast top-selling CD's
Why do half America got AIDS
Why do schools care about your son's braids more than they care for his grades
Why they hate our white t-shirts and hats turned backwards
And why is Jesus Christ never played by black actors
And why there ain't a MC that can touch me nor budge me
And why is Nas the best thing in rap since Chuck D
And why this record ain't sell 5 mill yet
Jada's as real as it get
Put my money where my mouth is
And do something bout this

[Chorus]

[Jadakiss]
Yo by thugs I'm surrounded
Tell me why is it the money motivates me but the love keeps me grounded
Why my cases ain't get thrown out
Why team USA keep getting blown out
Why the Democratic part ain't getting with me
Why they still hanging black bodies in Mississippi
Yea, why did governor McGrevey get caught with a lizard
Why they take away Shyne's phone calls and visits
Why I been hot for 7 years
Why the new M5 come with 7 gears
Please tell me why y'all keep making that trash
Why they reinstating the draft, why is it so much hating you have
And why sell records and keep working
Why we go on stage with the bread with the feet working
It's real, why when I loved on die you miss them
Why it took for me to make "Why" for y'all to listen

[Chorus]

    Leak it Out
   </title>
   <lyrics>
    [Intro]
Uh huh. Lets go Ace

[Verse One] [Masta Ace]
Ayo it's that exclusive song shit
That climb the charts, bang our chest, King Kong shit
Y'all ain't got no bomb shit
It's that, BK, Shaolin, Queens and Bronx shit (What about Milwaukee?)
And Manhattan shit (Oh)
We so passionate
This is in high demand we had to ration it
So come get ya daily dose
Cause that shit them niggas put out is barely close
It's the eMC and Leo's
And y'all gon' smell defeat like cheese Doritos
Call all your parole boards and P.O's
Cause DJ's bound to cut this up like kilos
And distribute it, y'all cant get rid of it
This ain't no mistake this shit's deliberate
And if y'all want that raw
Rap shit brought to your door
We the four that sure deliver it

[Stricklin]
Yes sir guess who back in the spot
Got them hands up, I ain't even packin' a glock
I'm just a hustler, I don't need to pack in my sock
Just give me Pro Tools, a Mbox, and a track if its hot
And this shit, make you wanna smack yo momma
I'm a star risin' like Barack Obama, the track so drama
I gets it poppin' in the hood like the 4th of July
Let it be understood, I'm not the nigga to try
Y'all ain't stoppin' our fame
Cause us not sellin' is like The Game not droppin a name
It's gon happen regardless, we the hardest
It's eMC, ya favorite artist's favorite artist

[Chorus]
Check, checkin' it out
Ya don't stop, eMC
You waited long enough, we must
Leak it out
Check, checkin' it out
Ya don't stop, eMC
You waited long enough, we must
Leak it out
"Guess what we's about to do" - Queen Latifah
Check, checkin' it out
Ya don't stop, eMC
You waited long enough, we must
Leak it out
Check, checkin' it out
Ya don't stop, eMC
You waited long enough, we must
Leak it out
"Tell 'em what it's about, no doubt, leak it out"

[Wordsworth]
Excuse me, I'm standin' in your way? (Uh huh)
Blockin' all the glamor, not an amateur
Don't gamble with a play
On the planet for the day, first we landin' in L.A.
Tour the planet, hit the Bay, then Atlanta in GA
You don't plan on shootin' nothin', so that hammer put away
That talk is outlandish, that you brandishin' is fray
The only cannon/Cannon that you shot was your camera
At a photo shoot we stay fresh like a mannequin display
With the grammar that I say I'm like an animal that's stray
Cause manners went away, people panic ran away
You ain't never drive a phantom any day
You couldn't buy tickets to the Opera with The Phantom in the play
It's like a brush fire, the flames that I spit
Cause it only spreads wider when you fannin' them away
And that mic in your palm, is like a baton
When you see me on the track then you handin' it away

[Punchline]
Yo, simple and plain
If they don't let me up in this game
I'm gonna rob the first idiot that's makin' it rain
No need to be poppin' them thangs
We can Scrap,
Like that dude that was dancin' with Kane
It's embedded in my D.N.A. strain
Best cat in the game
Up-bringin' made my thoughts insane
Real rhymers, you dealin' with rap's finest
We make the crowd say "hoe" like Don Imus
With one liners
If you willing to fight with this mic
Air you out like some white on whites
In town for one night, and we bringin' em out
Got no time for games, came to spit and be out

[Chorus]
Check, checkin' it out
Ya don't stop, eMC
You waited long enough, we must
Leak it out
Check, checkin' it out
Ya don't stop, eMC
You waited long enough, we must
Leak it out
"Guess what we's about to do" - Queen Latifah
Check, checkin' it out
Ya don't stop, eMC
You waited long enough, we must
Leak it out
Check, checkin' it out
Ya don't stop, eMC
You waited long enough, we must
Leak it out
"Tell 'em what it's about, no doubt, leak it out"

    Black Republicans

   <lyrics>
    [Intro]
Now this is what they've been waiting for
Ya dig, Santana
Weezy F.
Ay Wayne
What up man
What you been workin' on nigga?
Oh you know, I got Currency's new album
And prolly workin' on my album, ya dig
Oh I'm ready to brush my shoulders off and drop my next album too nigga
That's what it is
But dig this, they wanna know what we been workin' on together
That's that "I Can't Feel My Face Shit" they know that
So if they ever thought the South and the North was gonna collide
Guess what, we already did

[Juelz Santana]
I'm feelin' like a black Republican
Naw, I can't call it
More like a black Democrat runnin' 'em out of office
Young Barack Obama, I'm all for it
The Rock of Gibraltar has now fallen, on ya
I protect my land like a farmer
Pockets stay chubby like Tikara
Or should I say fat like the Parkers
Tote big guns like I'm still playin' Contra
Y'all washed up like money that's laundered
Y'all funny, I'm bonkers
Honest, girls strapped to my dick like a harness
Rock star, flier than an ostrich
And I cover east, west, north, south like a compass
I shall shine forever, never tarnish
Money buried behind my house like a garden
All green, my bank account's like a forest
I Can't Feel My Face is gettin' started
And Weezy is my accomplice, ya dig
A black activist like Sonny Carson
Stripes of a sergeant, salute me
And chicks, I get 'em high
Higher than turbulence is
White Phantom, lookin' so Fergielicious
I'm from the city of big drugs and murder victims
Its get rich, go to jail and be a murder victim
Ai!
Now all y'all listen
If you can't take the heat, get out the kitchen

[Lil Wayne]
I feel like a black Republican
Tote a MAC'n Republican
Act so southern n' die for my brethren
Money, money, money
Like money Mac and publishing
One life to live, never ask for a mulligan
Streets call but the heat make me feel covenant
Been done had cake day late like Anne Sullivan
Fly like an eagle but no I'm no Donovan
Boy you better go eat some soup with your mom n' them
And my mind is on another continent
I am real Cash Money, no counterfeit
I don't parkin' lot pimp I just politick
But I get all in her mouth like parlithins
New always represent it to the inner
Come from the city where the glitter don't glimmer
The sun don't shine and the guns don't sleep
Pick a nigga's ass up like he got somewhere to be

[Outro]
And we wanna let the world know
This is not a diss song either people
We don't diss them we dismiss 'em, ya dig
Recognize or step aside, ya dig
We let the music talk, Draught 3
And by the way, it's Santana, I'm back
It's Weezy!
You dudes gotta stand in the mirror backwards 'cause you can't face yourself
Assholes
DipSet for life
Cash Money, whaddup
Young Money

   <lyrics>
    [Intro: Method Man]
Yeah, nice
Dedicated to all the beautiful people in the house
You know who you are
Yeah, Redman, Method Man, Blackout! 2
Sexy...

[Method Man]
Hair and nails done up, girl, you got your act together
You get the thumbs up, your raw footage is uncut
Fronting like them goodies is untouched
We both knew this money's is young bucks
Ma, you ever take a trip to Shang-a-lot
Too many hard shames, the hardest one is saying goodbye
Look here, time is money, let me save you some time
And in your spare time, fully understand I'm a rare find
You know, so pick a day and pick a place and we there for sure
Slow up the pace, this ain't no race, and there you go
I'm dope money, girl, that mean I got cash to blow
She love it though, she so international
Not around the way, around the world
And you be stunting when you around your girls
But you classy, though, I'm feeling your vibe, you feeling the high
The G4 is ready to fly, is you ready to ride?
Let's go

[Chorus: Erick Sermon (Method Man) {Redman}]
International (Now we can creep, we can lay on the beach, you know
Then hit the sheets, I'll let you play with my feet, you know
She keep it low, she so international)
International {Hey, I like a girl that'll roll me a blunt, you know
With pretty feet, cook me something to eat, you know
You not a groupie, you're international}

[Redman]
Hey, you know me, girl, who I be, girl
The big whale that bailed outta SeaWorld
What's your name, show me I.D., girl
You look black and a little Chinese, girl
Hey, wait a minute, where you going, shorty?
Try to sneak past me like you ain't balling
You look sweet like Tweet, baby, c-c-call me
Matter of fact, wasn't you on Maury?
I'm just playing, hey miss thang
Hey, hey, miss thang, how you gon' miss me?
I got tickets, let's roll to the Knicks game
You Teena Marie, and baby, I'm Rick James
Excuse me, where you going, mama?
I wanna change, I voted for Obama
Bring in the new, kick out the old timers
Let's talk while we go and meet your mama

[Chorus: Erick Sermon (Redman) {Method Man}]
International (Hey, I like a girl that's thick in the waist, you know
The kind of girl, that'll finish your plate, you know
You not greedy, you international)
International {The type of chick I like'll wheelie your bike, you know
Rock the mic, roll a Philly uptight, you know
I like it though, she so international}

[Method Man]
Seems to me, me, you a queen to be
You mean girl, but you don't mean to be
Got your crown and your throne, little castle you can rest your dome
And we can smoke a little greenery, you know?
You getting that dough, let's get it and go on this cruise
I'm taking it slow, you painting your toes, and it's cool
Fuck with your dude, I'm fucking with you
Like an overnight celebrity, Miss Nothing to Lose

[Redman]
Yo, hey, hey, miss lady, my boricua
I heard your Applebum like Bonita
Your accent telling me you from the eastside
Take off your shoes, you bout five feet high
I get high, what about you?
A jungle brother, and baby I house you
Your feet looking real good in them house shoes
You're not a groupie, you international

[Chorus: Erick Sermon]
International...

    Woodstock Hood Hop
   </title>
   <lyrics>
    [Intro: M.O.P.]
Hahaha... they think they run or somethin
We definitely got to give the drummer somethin (c'mon!)
Slaughterhouse (c'mon!) M.O.P. (c'mon!)
Everybody (c'mon!)

[Joell Ortiz]
H-E- (what?) L-L-O, I'm one hell of a show
I'm the best, you stuck in the middle like L-M-N-O
I'll piss on you, let every toxic elements go
All you pussies is fucked, call me now celibate Joe (ay!)
Ay Slaughterhouse, let's go rock "Ed Sullivan Show"
I literally can't front, I'm back like never befo' (oh!)
I'ma rap my letter to hoes
"Dear prostitute, I miss y'all lettin me slap my head on your nose"
Where the fuck is my guitar? It couldn't of went far
Oh yeah, I smashed it on homie head in that Brook-lyn bar
Man I'm somewhere in between a crook and a star
Had some more bars but I left my rap book in the car (yo yo yo yo yo)

[Chorus: M.O.P.]
Yo, this that Woodstock hood hop!
Hands up if you fuckin with it
We reppin Brooklyn (c'mon!) Jersey (c'mon!)
Long Beach (c'mon!) Detroit (c'mon!)

[Crooked I]
Geah, spaz out, knock a nigga ass out
Knew he had a paper thin chin and a glass mouth
West Coast shit, seven-deuce glass house
Got a +Lil' Fame+ so me and my +Posse Mash Out+ (ohh!)
I ain't got a college degree
Just the Circle of Bosses, the Slaughter's in me, pardon me G
I just wanna fuck your daughter and flee
And leave all that married shit in the background like I'm Father MC
Ha ha, cocky, but don't be a copycat
When you see me rockin that, L.A. Kings hockey hat
I'm the king of L.A., do you copy that?
It's time for some change like Obama in a laundry-mat

[Chorus]

[Royce Da 5'9"]
Do y'all want problems with us? I guess not
Broadcastin live from a Pyrex pot
The steeets know that we nice, try your best shot
Speech coded in ice, dialect's hot
Everybody (c'mon) get cool
Beef in big shoes, gun talkin repetitive call it Chip-Fu
You ain't never heard of me mami you excused
I don't only diss dudes
You sleepin on us, that's what it is - just understand
that I ain't gettin a wink of sleep 'til you lookin at the back of your lids
I'm a lyrical ounce of PIFF
Still countin them chips, for real mami, Slaughterhouse in this {"BITCH!"}

[Chorus]

[Joe Budden]
Look, I'm not a gang-banger, more like game changer
with tamed anger, alias lover name changer
Liable to pop at kids and aim flamers
I'm why your parents told you not to entertain strangers
Dope get it, top notch, flow sickest
Best out, don't blame me it's no spitters
So vicious on the road to riches
From now on call me Mr. Weiss, they chasin all of your old bitches
From the hood New Jersey and I claim this
Oxymoron, rob with the dirty and stainless
Cock back, high saddity so I keep the top back
So when the streets is watchin, I could watch back

[Chorus] - repeat 2X

    Mr. Pigface
   </title>
   <lyrics>
    [Intro]
C.O.B. is my religion
I was raised in the world, that wants to see me dead or locked up
What they have to do to this monster{?}
Pigface Weapon Waist nigga!

[Crooked I]
Yo, yo
I won't be finished 'til I'm mentioned with the best ever
I rock a record like I'm a member of Def Leppard
I keep my eyes on my prey like I'm a deaf leopard
You better crown me or I'll jump you like a red checker
I'll chop your head off, I aim fifths and circum-
-cize all of you guys cause it ain't shit to merk 'em
I look into they eyes and see the same bitch that birthed 'em
Pussy, I'm deranged, I'm insane, sick, berserk, I'm
pain mixed with anguish, my language is game mixed
with dangerous heinous spit, I shit, you a anus
Nigga I'm idiotic, and really got it
You fuck with me and them bullets'll be movin quick as Sonic
I'm hangin out the window like a nigga finna vomit gin and tonic
Guns sound like a astroid hit a comet!
Yesterday I was loadin my pistol on my momma's couch
Thought about my fucked up life, and yelled SLAUGHTERHOUSE!

[Interlude]
The beast was pregnant, with Pigface Weapon Waist
The belly of the beast gave birth to a menace
Now they can't control me

[Crooked I]
Yeah, I kill you with no strings attached, this is Wi-Fi
'Til the wheels fall off, I'm down to do the drive-by (nigga!)
Not to be cocky but I'm gooned up, why lie?
That's why I got the upper hand like a high-five
Bet you never seen chrome tecs
I make a call, I get you pussies touched, call it phone sex
Ain't no tellin what I'm on next
Long texts from your wife, tornado dick, I home wrecks
I'll have that bitch sellin her coochie lips
Bougie chicks get the coke nose, 'til they loaded as my uzi clip
Even broke hoes on the groupie shit
Pretty as a beauty tip, get the Max Julien movie script
Welcome to my world, hot iron, shots firin
Cops tryin to stop a mob giant
I'll drop block science, and after I'm gone I'll picture hip-hop cryin
like they did with Big and 'Pac dyin, I'm not lyin

[Interlude]
For every one dead, two more are born
You can't stop real niggaz
You'll never stop real niggaz

[Crooked I]
Yo, my +Family Ties+ just as deep as Michael J. Fox
We aim glocks at your tanktops
Leave you in a hospital bed, watchin "Baywatch"
Watch your weight drop, 'til you're skinny enough to fit between raindrops
Bang shots - we killin you on YouTube
BONO~! Nigga that means you too
I got a screw loose, you get stuck up like goody-two-shoes
Thought you knew, that I was CUCKOO!
I'm in a GT ay, I got them thangs on me
I'm in a +GTA+, but I ain't Gay Tony
A menace to society, I'm MC Eiht's homie
The killer gorilla apes know me, Ma$e pray for me
No lyricist realer, straight Kobe, can't hold me
I flash player, couldn't read me with Adobe (naw!)
So a new verse is nothin but a new hearse
Tryin to kill G shit I'm shootin yellin "You first!"
Nigga!

[Interlude]
You'll never kill G shit (never!)
Until you change society, this shit won't stop (never)
Art imitates life nigga
Fox News wanna kill Obama, like the Long Beach PD wanna kill me
(Tell 'em!) Ha ha ha ha
But I won't die, I multiply
C.O.B. (C.O.B.!)
It's my religion (my religion)
That's why they follow me (follow me!)
Salute your general
Pigface, Weapon Waist nigga! (yeah, yeah)
Amen

[Outro: Crooked I]
Yeah, it's that shit
I'm tired of you nigga, wack nigga, soft nigga
Long Beach, Eastside
Yeah, let this motherfucker ride
Let the motherfucker RIDE
21 on the beat, sup 21? Deuce-one! Ha ha ha
It's epic, a journey
21 on the beat, sup 21? Deuce-one! Ha ha ha
Oh yeah... C.O.B.!

    Fear of God
   </title>
   <lyrics>
    "A spiritually do you fear the wrath of God?"

[Hell Razah]
Lights, cameras, and action
I write down lyrics of passion
A Christ like it's back then but wit a Mac-10
For all the Romans and the Anglo-Saxons
That old serpent now turned into a dragon
Ever since I was solo I heard 'em taking shots on the low-low
Even though it broke my heart, why? Manolo
I'm loco, can easily snap without a four-door
The wrong one to come up on to get promo
Be with Silverback thugs, we give you bear hugs
When we bussing our guns you need earplugs
If it ain't war from above then what you scared off?
They ain't use to no cakes so when they choose they fate
You get the fiery lakes instead of the golden gates
I give bulletproof love so I'm immune to hate
So if you're bugging the gas then I'm a fumigate
I'm where the angels and the Son of Man communicate
I'm a Rabbi samurai, sword for outta nine
Say goodbye to my pop at five
And inspire for the All-Seeing-Eye
Inside the studio booth could be the alibi
Salute the El Shaddai or each and every tribe
You need a Heavenly mind you wanna read my vibe
I'm on another page (You on the wrong chapter)
Another chalice of grand coo
Cali kush and visual bamboo
This year we flip our money like an Al Green sample
Soon to blow, we ain't talking bout ya birthday candles
I'm back cuz a rap left you a bad example
When you gamble you lose like the Watergate Scandal
My handle on the trey pound is rubber grip
Go and get any dog you stick and I'm a kill 'em like Michael Vick
I sit like I'm in the cockpit of the mother-ship
Your diamonds is conflict compared to my conscious
I'm in the zone, call me Ron Sterling but just a lil darker
The legendary rap Charlie Parker
The Godfather wit a sharpie marker
More smarter, so I got a better business partner
Jackie Robinson whips, Brooklyn Dodgers
I'm J.A. Rogers wit a chrome revolver
You need Viagra pills to go Carter
I'm more sharper then the ice pick
My mic sick, got the flu virus
Started seance for ghost writers
Go head and sell me out to Pontius Pilate
They blocked their numbers and they call me private
Too many foe tech conversations
Y'all don't really want no confrontation
Abomination of desolation, got Obama pacing
Back and forth, blessed be the patient
They said I should of been an outpatient
Inside of hospitals its Satan's matrix
For being God's favorite who loved Jacob but he hated Essau
Hit the detonator for the C-4 on the Eastern seaboard
For all the soldiers that's in the street war
I breathe for the younger children that's on the sea shore
And this circus of this chitterlings circuit
Same Sambo's but different curtains
So I don't end up as a missing person
Or bystander when I'm spitting verses
FEMA coffins ain't no need for hearses
Turn ya gun into the nearest Churches

    Toney Sigel (The Barrel Brothers) (Remix)
   </title>
   <lyrics>
    [Ghostface Killah]
Yo, straight out the ghetto, I'm damn hood
I Stack-A-Dollar like a whole rack of canned goods
Baggy jeans, no Timbs, A.C.G. boots
Living in the Crack Spot, banging at Sheek Louch
The narcotics is far from garbage
Whether it's cold or it's late August
My shit is fresh cuz I catch the harvest
My little cousin bubble Swatches and carry a couple oxes
Keep a duece-deuce by his ankle and get it popping
You know, we be the boys clocking the graveyard shift
Big bundles, counting our CREAM, burning the lazer spliff
My man, jumps out the whip with the A.R. fifth
And we barred from plenty of parties cuz we start shit
Parole hoes, six months in the box
My little sister got her head shaved off
She made it home from shop
We selling cartons, Pampers, Similac formula
Anything it take because the paper keep calling ya
Gangstas keep balling for sure, we want more
We make it rain from the tech and wop
The Lex pouring and the precincts don't have enough cups for us
To slow us up, they hit us with dust
Then they rush, bust, my big man Ron'll break the cuffs
Three-hundred pound nigga, po-po has to fuck him up
They say that my projects shall undergo therapy
We never voted, we voting for Oprah, Obama, and Eric B.

[Styles P]
The ill rap niggaz that kill
Destroy shit but they able to build
Come fuck with the real
Coward, better play your part
This shit'll lace yo' heart
Get hit with a Ghostface dart
And you better live this shit to fullest
Or be ready to pull it
Or be hit with a B. Sig' bullet
The ill rap niggaz that kill
Destroy shit but they able to build
Come fuck with the real

[Beanie Sigel]
It's the Broad Street Bully and the Killah with no face
My mack bullets burn like tequila with no chase
My knifework like a guillotine sword cutting
Niggaz stop fronting for my Killa Beez swarm something
Bzzz, empty out the whole clip then reload
Shotgun barrel leave it smoking like a broke stove
Yeah, and I'm all about that bullshit
The casket, the hearse and the pastor in the pulpit
I kill a nigga at the drop of a dime
Just imagine what I do for a quarter
Ain't no telling what I do for a dollar
Pop a nigga right in front of his mama
Son a nigga right in front of his daughter
And I'm nothing like the father
He couldn't come from these nuts I got
Or see Baltimore suck this cock
I know most of y'all wouldn't understand
Get it... get it... understand
Yeah, some niggaz will, and some niggaz won't
Like some niggaz kill, and some niggaz don't
You'se a fake until you make it type of nigga
I'm a straight up take it type of nigga
Pistol whip a nigga 'til I break it type of nigga
I'm hard on chumps, most these dudes is fags
Put the guard on punks, push the broom up they ass
Or the knife like American meat
American Sig', it's Muslim, so I ain't feeling Bush overseas
I think with the wisdom of Malcolm, got the soul of a panther
So "By Any Means" is the anthem, you gon' have to cut me out the track
like cancer
I can't stop, won't stop, this how we do it from Philly to Shaolin
All my niggaz swap in (Yeah nigga)

[Solomon Childs]
Guns imported from Dubai, wheelchairs and shitbags
Peach Snapples and pretty scapals
Renaissance, I'll stick a pick in ya gut at the chapel
Or blow a nigga for a box of Huggies
Cop killas with a box of dummies
Gummies, stuck to the project floors
Niggaz is suited up and we ready for war

We make it rain from the tech and the wop
The next coroner priests don't have enough cups for us
To slow us up, they hit us with dusk
Then they rush-bust, my man Big Ron will break the cuffs
300 pound nigga, po po has to fuck him up
They say that my projects should undergo therapy
We never voted, we votin' for Oprah, Obama, and Eric B.

[Chorus]
Guns imported from Dubra
Wheelchairs and shit bags
Peach Snapples and pretty scalpels
Renaissance
I'll stick a pick in yo gut at the chapel
I'll blow a nigga for a box of Huggies
Cop killers with a box of dummies
Dummies stuck to the project floors
Niggas is suited up and be ready for war

[Beanie Sigel - Verse 2]
It's the Broadstreet Bully and the Killah with no Face
My mac bullets burn like tequila with no chase
My knife work like the guillotine sword
Cut niggas, stop frontin' for my killa bee swarm, something
Empty out the whole clip and reload
Shot gun barrel leave you smokin like a broke stove
Yeah, and I'm all about that bullshit
The casket, the hearse, and the pastor in the pulpit
I kill a nigga at the drop of a dime
Just imagine what I do for a quarter
Ain't no tellin what I do for a dollar
Pop a nigga right in front of his mama
Son a nigga right in front of his daughter
And im nothin like a father
Couldn't come from these nuts I got
To see Baltimore suck this cock
I know most of y'all wouldn't understand
Get it, understand
Yeah some niggas will and some niggas won't
Like some niggas kill and some niggas don't
You's a fake it 'til you make it type a nigga
I'm a straight up take it type a nigga
Pistol whip a nigga 'til I break it type a nigga
I'm hard on chumps, most of these dudes is fags
Put the guarder on pumps, push the broom up they ass
Or the knife like American me, American Sig' is Muslim
So I ain't feelin Bush overseas
I think with the wisdom of Malcom, got the soul of a panther
So by any means is the anthem
You gonna have to cut me out the track like cancer
I can't stop won't stop
This how we do it from Philly to Shaolin...

    Pain

   <lyrics>
    [samples]
From CNN world international, this is world news
*gunshot*
I don't think there is such a thing as a good war
There are sometimes necessary wars
It was something that had to be done
The real war involves getting down there and killing people
And being killed yourself or just barely escaping
It gives you attitudes about God, life and death
That are unattainable anywhere else
I'm not sure I can speak about why human beings in general go to war
I think that's a large category, they go to war because it's impossible not to
Being shot, you saw them fall, because these things you saw
And the fact that this is for real...

[Noreaga]
Unh!!  Unh!!  Unh!! Yo, yo!!
Waking up, cold in my eyes, two phillies ready rolled on the dresser
My chick hatin', I won't stress her,
Probably get her mad and pay attention much lesser
Hit the closet up, brush my teeth and get fresher
These things real you can bring your diamond tester
I see through your glass my dude, like Large Professor
My nigga died that night, lampin on the park bench
I'm kinda hurt, I ain't been back to the park since
See I'm a G holla, high like comets
And I ain't with the shit, I despise all the garments
Demise what you garbage, your whole team is green littered
Which means your target's not safe in the markets
I inherit niggaz beef quite frequently, that's why they call me Warrior N.O.R.E.
When they speak of me, Gangsta, Monster Kody, parolee
I'm on my Din, Hakeem, Allahu Akbar
Swing big swords, cut in half a cop car
My nigga Truth rock stock rims Magnum
Fuck them groupie hoes cause we been done had them
Bust nuts off, lower they facial
I'm a Geto Boy like Bushwick and Face
And I always had a record, I was born with a case
I feel pain

[hook: Capone (Noreaga)]
Been through it all in my life
I done watched close niggaz to me die by the gun and the knife
(I feel pain)
This for niggaz on they own or locked up on the phone
And they never comin home, y'know? (I feel pain)
Look what happened to Haiti it's all crazy
Everynight I go to sleep and kiss my baby
(I feel pain)
Everyday the same story, war hustle, territory
We just try'na see the glory, y'know?

[Capone]
Ayo it's fucked up my nigga Black Box died on christmas eve
My other homie on his birthday
Now we on the block thinkin revenge, not hearin what his Earth say
Lookin at his seed make me want it in the worst way
Besides that my other nigga got cancer and just found out that his wife is a dancer
So many questions all I need is an answer
I done did so much dirt ain't no room in the hamper, check it
I got scars on top of scars, William Wallace renegade,
Most of you niggaz sweeter than lemonade
We bloody up your garments, nigga this is phonics
I ain't speakin in ebonics take my words as a promise
Get Obama on the line tell him raise the threat level
We the last real niggaz standin when the dust settle
When it's war dunn, the beef never stops
It comes right back around like the hands on a watch
Army fatigue, fox, 40 below Timbs
501 Denims, coca sales with no lens
Just to see the snakes clear cause I ain't got no friends
Only my brother from another mother we goes in
My gun' the alarm, bullets fatter than Big Mama
To deal wit' the pain I smoke scamah (I feel pain)

    Strangers (Paranoid)
   </title>
   <lyrics>
    * send corrections to the typist

[Intro - Talib Kweli - talking]
Yeah, beca-ca-ca, beca-ca-ca, because I'm paranoid
Beca-ca-ca, beca-ca-ca, because I'm paranoid
Beca-ca-ca, beca-ca-ca, because I'm paranoid
Hey, hey, yeah!

[Verse 1 - Talib Kweli]
No boundaries, no borders, we crossin many waters
Them haters can't ignore us, the government record us
They used to take our sons and think it's fun to rape our daughters ... no!
Our healthcare system pitiful, that's how hospitals' profitable
They try to put the drugs inside of you, lie to you, say that you gonna die tomorrow
So why pay? That's not logical
See the bullshit that they try to pull? ... whoa!
They tappin laptops like a bad plot out of a bad movie, Obama say it ain't so
In a perfect world coalition of the willing is really coalition of the rainbow
Who the enemy? Who the friend in need?
How do you choose your target, who you aim for? What you aim for? ... damn!
Still running with the race but I'm runnin at a pace
So fast, you collapse, gotta let it go
Wondering if my concentration on the race misplaced, turn your marks, set, ready, go
Evolutionary flow, every luminary glow
When he show what the revolutionary know, oh! Blaap!

[Chorus - Talib Kweli]
Shot to make you famous, we're in your face with bangers
About to face some danger, I just misplace my anger
The violence entertain us, rappers took the place of sangers
Mama said don't talk to strangers, don't talk to strangers

[Verse 2 - Bun B]
Gotta let the people know from the get go, Bun B is a product of the ghetto
Good or bad man I just can't let go, no I ain't a rich man but I'm still set though
And I'm still on the grind tryin to get dough, why the government wanna keep me in debt for?
They wanna keep me in debt for? ...
Look at AIG and the bailouts, steppin on the fence just who they have to whale out
Got his ass on 'em or should I say tail out, need another job like a paper or a mail route
Bring the fresh fest in, take the stale out, make it rain D.C. and I'm a pull a pail out ...
Man I'm a put a pail out, know what I'm sayin?
'Cause I'm stuck in the mud like a tractor, I ain't gotta lie plus I'm not a good actor
Bullshit laws that they enact to, keep us locked out the big game in the back bro
I got set now I gotta get a setter, make ends meet 'cause the money is a factor
Oh yeah the money is a factor ... damn!
Now I'm back on the block for the hustle, used to be hot, now your boy just cold
Gotta build my bread up and my muscle, haters talk down, sometimes it's a tussle
But the smoke gonna clear and the dust'll settle, now it's like Def Jam with no Russell
Like Def Jam with no Russell ... We'll be alright though

[Chorus]

    Gettin' Money Freestyle
   </title>
   <lyrics>
    Intro:
Please be clear. This is a fuckin' invasion. Royce Da 5'9"

Verse One:
I'm gettin' money like a motherfucka
I do dollar like the Yao stretch
Casino chips that Denale bet
Ain't spazzin' at the house party
Mink draggin'/dragon like Bilil breath
dead prez ran a train on the green lady
That green lady turned around and had a dream baby
That dream baby was I
That green lady was ma
Follow me honey, it sound funny
I'm money
Get it?
Niggas is idiots so probably not
I Murder Inc., let Ashanti &amp; Irv Gotti watch
A walkin' mollie wop
Tell your whole fellat to cock off
Drop the jeans
And take out a foot like when you take a sock off
I ain't attached to no tooley
I quite screwy
I just take the Lock off
Pop it and Drop It like Huey
Weed avenue, bread rollin' on Phillie Street
Triggers get used more than Wayne on +Milli+ beat
So don't make me laugh
You think with your class
I think with my math
Not with my dick, I speak on his behalf
Anyone of you motherfuckin' NASCAR tunnel crews
I call you that, cause you fixin' to crash
The word in the hood is I got the bag in the streets
Pull the rig up
Take a load off, like I'm havin' a seat
This black coup is V-12 as far as year
I'm been rappin', reppin' the D-12, ask Proof
As far as tears
My face ain't big enough to relate
How many bodies gone in the form of a tattoo
Alcoholic, my kidney color is black blue
Forever fuck with that Remy, love it like Papoose
Wearin' that XXL mag or in The Source
Being the king of the magazines and in a Porsche
My release date is more important to the country than
Tunin' into your news stations November 4th (Obama!)
I turn niggas into veggies and get my lettuce straight
It's like you niggas addicted to bitch shit, you fetish fake
Dahlmer
Pop you, then eat you on the anniversary of your death
Like the top of a wedding cake
Two timer
Yeah, I keep a bitch on the side
I'm Mr. Warning Guy
You Mr. Wanna Die
The Bar Exam 2 comma
More polished than
Ray Robinson in his prime
The shoe shiner
He kill 'em with his persistence
Sendin' niggas to hit 'em is a silly mission
Like he's one of Diddy's assistants
Look in my trunk and find a pair of legs inside of some gym shoes
Hangin' out a trash bag and in fumes
I spit whole winters and then June
Show up to your video while you performin'
And shoot you like Ben Boom
You might have dealt with the tools
But you ain't swam with them sharks
Nickle, Mike Phelps in the pool
You might pull triggers but you don't pull them like me
Bullets runnin' through shit like the bullets got feet
I'm gonna keep goin' and goin' like a Energizer
Inside a flyin' bullet until the day a bullet stops me
Fuck a bitch, I'm it nigga, I'm a don
I'm the reaper on Cancer, like I'm a sign
Immaculately conceived
Product of dollar signs
The only father of mine
Is Father Time

Chorus:
I'm gettin' money like a motherfucker
You ain't got nothin' on me
I'm gettin' money like a motherfucker
Fuck this auto tune shit
That shit sound weak as a bitch
Unless it's me usin' it
Cause I'm the shit fool

    We Get it In
   </title>
   <lyrics>
    [Intro: Trife Diesel]
Uh, we get it in, S.I.N.Y., nigga, we get it in
Stapleton, Theodore niggas, we get it in
Them T.M.F. --- we get it in
S.I.N.Y., nigga, we get it in (The Money First)
Them T.M.F., we get it in (Too Much Fucking)
T.M.F., all day, we get it in (oh!)
Yo, yo

[Trife Diesel]
I'm the jet signer, sip champagne on jet liners
Leave ya apron, cooking up coke in the Chef's diner
Touch niggas like old pedophiles who sex minors
Leave you lost in the back of the woods where they can't find ya
Vagina Monologue, you soft, straight pussy
For the strip with them watery dips and them beige cookies
Fuck a price range, I blew ten stacks on a dice game
Place your bets, if it's less than a quarter, it's slight change
I'm on a night train to Georgia, got to fill these orders
I'm paper stacking, ya'll just looking silly on them corners
Keep away from them fed lovers and watch for informers
My bitch got a gun license, cuz them glocks stay up on us
Riding dirty with kevlar vestes, who wan' test us?
Let my goons go to work on the first, nigga who sent you
I'm connected with mob bosses, and guineas, Jamaicans and Trini's
And rude boys who act a fool up for Henny

[Chorus: Trife Diesel]
44's, big burners, that raw, bang up on your man
Corridors, to the mess hall, nigga we get it in
Razorblades that'll fuck up your fade and give you a trim
We experts with them gems, and nigga we get it in
S.I.N.Y. (nigga we get it in)
Them Stapleton, Theodore nigga (we get it in)
Whether on the streets busting our heat or locked in the pen
I repeat once again (my nigga, we get it in)

[Trife Diesel]
I stay high off the wibble, niggas speaking in riddles
But I leave 'em all wet like Daytona Beach when it drizzle
Catch me on the creep late night like Jimmy Kimmel
Black down, hoodied up so you know I'm strapped with the pistol
An iron nickle and twist you, turn you into a cripple
Get plugged with hot slugs that'll burn your bone to the grissle
Meat hanging off of your tissue, and once my nigga Hawk blow the whistle
Be weary, coming to get you
Them F boys pull up in stretch toys, and we heavily armed
With them tools like mechanics who work in Pep Boys
Rapid fire, black attire, feds wanna tap the wire
Sammy Gravanos get hollow, dead in they condo
Bloody vets spread from beating this nigga head like a bongo
Guerilla warfare we was born and raised in the congos
The Stapleton rock crushers, spot rushers, block busters
Yo, Snips, let these niggas know now they can not touch us

[Chorus]

[Trife Diesel]
Meet the kid with the sinister grin who kill innocent men
And drew blood from the minister's pen
I get it in, lock and load, watch how my shot gon' blow
Contact the main headquarters tell them the shop is closed
I move with a flock of hoes, who get skiied, smoke weed and eat Dominos
Wild like some refugees in Guantanamo, quick to let the llama go
And any given night I slay mics like Geronimo
I live for the drama though, Barack Obama
I'm the only man breathing that can stop Osama
Bulletproof humvees, no honor amongst thieves
When I spit, let off a hundred shot clip with one squeeze
One shot, one kill, never will the sun chill
Mr. Hancock, getting money like a young Will
Assassinate a nation, man up your battle stations
Battle Satan walking through hell with the power nation

[Chorus]

   <lyrics>
    [Intro] [Royce talking]
You are now rocking to the sounds of my dawg. DJ Green Lantern
Bar Exam 2 nigga. It's a motherfuckin' holiday bitches

[Verse One] [June the Great]
I slang hope to the world like my name was Obama
Shakin' hands with your father while I'm fuckin' yo momma
Drama
But I'ma say I'm in a league of my own
Blowin' my own horn
Horns of my cousin, Chevy in Texas
I had to shout him out he's from the south
Got pussy with me for my brother when he get out
No doubt
It goes one for the money
Two for the show
Three for the M.I.C. now let's go
June's flow is pro
Turn my speakers up louder
Learn my shit
Then recite it up in the shower
No homo
Yeah, peep my promo on behalf of the Bar Exam 2
This is my message from me to you
They'll probably be happy when I'm long gone
But that'll never happen cause I got way too many songs
MC's take note, but don't quote too much
Find your own style and get 'mo in touch
Plus
Pussy make the world go round and mine spinnin' out of control
Where I'ma stop, nobody knows
You don't want me close to ya
Scared I might roast ya
But if I should stop, then who these streets gonna toast to?
Here's the book of life, I just wrote you a new page
Inspired by the beat, by the smell of my purple haze
Hey, Grand River niggas up to no good
June 1st
I bring you all closer to my hood

[Chorus]
Wall Street
Wall Street
Yeah, yeah
Uh huh

[Verse Two]
My appetite for destruction
My type to do the bustin'
I eat the beat up like I got an appetite for percussion
Lighten the mood like it's night and there's moonlight
Platoon, high on them shrooms but this ain't no food fight
Witch
I could fly on a broom stick to my rude type
My crew don't be 'bout no excuses, gesundheit
God bless you, sneeze
I'll wet you, sleeves
Your arms ain't like ours yet, our recipe is...
Beef on a platter
Go on and chatter, it don't matter
My cheese, I'm eatin' like I'm obese but only fatter
I only know how to do it the Harriet Tub way
I'm Underground like the Railroad, I'm prepared to get ugly
My narrative thug day, can only compare me to drugs
I take a nigga way from him like Jared from Subway
You, could, never ever be on my level
You don't know what you're in
But you're in/urine guns like I took a pee on my metal
Just me and my shuttle
We fly
We go together like my feet and my petal
We ride
How could I not be greatest?
When I got Muhammad Ali boxin' inside me in Vegas
Aye
Haters
I just wanna say this
I know I'm underrated
But I ain't under paid when it comes to makin'
Money
I'm so hot I feel like the son of Satan
I'm so hot I feel like the sun is hatin'
Your bitch
Hhhhuhhhhuhhhh
Breathin' like a hundred H's
I am the reason for your under takin'
There's only one equation
And it equals I am the sum of greatness

Yeah, yeah
Uh huh

   <lyrics>
    [Intro] [Royce talking]
Yeah, Bar Exam 2 nigga. It's a motherfuckin' holiday bitches

[Verse One] [Canibus]
Bar Exam 2
I landslide you to lava below
Gotta stance nigga flow
How bars? How far can you go?
Only as far as the mind
Canibus and Royce 5'9"
Bar Exam 2, spit a rhyme
A miniature version of me, told me he wanted to MC
I told him, "Be careful who you be."
He said, "I'ma just be me."
I said, "Yeah, I see. But you don't understand what I really mean."
Look at the manifest list
It got my name down
A bald head for the cool crown
How you like me now?
I terrorize rap music
What manner of creature could do this?
Canibus stupid
Retarded, autistic artists
You click, perfects target
Staff Sargent Canibus talkin'
I would not let off the gas
Traverse it through San Stone's past
The Ripper spills whiskey from a flask

[Verse Two] [Elzhi]
I toke green, blowin' out smoke screens
Poke queens, leave them with soaked jeans
You're the definition of what "joke" mean
I'm star status
Like glowin' lights throughout the far stratos-
-Phere, it's clear who repertoire that is
Pursue whites and fuck a shoe price
My cheese outgrew mice
I'm too nice, cut through slice, I'm seein' you twice
The lead pacer
Been makin' moves like Speed Racer
Indeed tracin' line that fucks with your mind like a weed lacer
Try and boast, ain't lyin' close, so what I diagnose
I could fry and roast any guy till they applyin' ghost
Pee on peons beyond eons
Till there's neon Klingons
Close encounter of the three kinds
You may fall, I'm AWOL, my heaters will spray y'all
And put you in a hole like Robert Peter to pay Paul
I could give a fuck
Got a flow to leave a river stuck
You hear deep it lines ? ? ? ?

[Verse Three] [Royce Da 5'9"]
Osama McCain, you climb in this ring
Rhyming with Obama the king
End up on the bottom of the things
Living inside of ominous springs
I'mm in a dream
I spit the only kind of sickness that vomiting brings
That means I'm ill sick
And plus I'm real bitch
I should've played Hancock instead of Will Smith
Cos I'm drunk and flyer
I'm the super hero minus all the chump attire
and I bleed hardly
tell your idol his times up
and he's barbe-cue
every rhyme lined up like steve harvey's do
from the pies to the brick man
niggas couldn't follow in my steps 'less I died in some quick sand
so come and see a nigga burn a show
and give me a hand before I give you the fist like a germaphobe
and you probably too scary to scuffle
if you ain't hit a nigga before you buried your knuckles
I got a hundred round drum
I shoot the first thirty to kill everybody that trash your hook up
category blast the butcher
empty the clip just to make that 70 show like ashton kutcher
nigga you at war with sharks the government team
will leave you airless/heirless like jordan sparks or a motherless queen
we put it on y'all, tape a niggas phone call
sell it to the net for a phone card
then use it to phone y'all mommas
I throw you niggas a bone and then I bury the drama in a bone yard
the flow's in prime
I got more plastic on me than all of hugh heffner's hoes combined
my niggas got GT's and shit, yeah I know mini coopers
while you niggas rolling around in the mini coopers
I'm the shit for real, y'all niggas mini poopers
drunk, wildin, commitin vodka and henny bloopers
who could give a nigga the snoop foot
stretch him out on the floor like the Manut look
you shook, nigga I'm like the crew cook
I put a price on the whip and I'm like the blue book
with an appetite for destruction with the greed stigma
explains my past and adds to my enigma
if it's digital or analog
Bar Exam 2 is the present, the distributor is Santa Claus

    Say Something
   </title>
   <lyrics>
    {*opening the same as the break from Lords of the Underground's "Funky Child"*}

[Talib Kweli]
The year is 1975 (yeah, hahaha!)
Brooklyn, New York City (stand up)
A child destined for greatness is born (we goin in)
Let's go!

Get your hands in the air (get 'em up~!)
Put your hands in the air (put 'em up~!)
Get your hands in the air (get 'em up~!)
Put your hands in the air (put 'em up~!)

[Chorus]
Talk shit now (now... now... now... ) What? What?
Talk shit now (now... now... now... ) What?
Talk shit now (now... now... now... ) What?
Talk shit now (now... now... now... ) What?
Talk shit now (now... now... now... )
Say something, say something (what was that?)
Say something (I dare you), say something

[Talib Kweli]
+The Lord Chief Rocka+ I'm colder than meatlockers
My people keep throwin it up like cheap vodka
I smack internet MC's and beat bloggers
You can see my +Black Thought+ like 'Riq Trotter
It's deep, go ahead and sleep, they know in the street
Kwe' gon flow on the beat proper composin complete operas
Longer than a cigar that's Godfather
Tappin two heart chakras I'm harder than gobstoppers
People comin for the throne not knowin the seat hotter
than fish grease, criminal names on police blotters
You convinced me, I hit targets like top shotters
Out in the mideast like Muslims takin Shahada
I'm sayin makin a profit a product of Reaganomics
Awake and I'm stayin conscious to radio playin garbage (yeh!)
Blacksmith Music, if you don't pay homage
I'ma show you how we break an artist
That's a threat, I'm not makin a promise
Speak to the people like Barack Obama
They worship like the black Madonna, c'mon
Niggaz talk shit, but they ain't got skills
I'm the type of nigga to put lead in your grill
Number two pencil is sharper to bruise mentals, and
beatin in my chest is the heart of a true gentleman
Still spit right in your face
Fuck a Top 8, back up, gimme +MySpace+ you're not safe

{*Lords of the Underground horn break again*}
Hahahaha
Yeah, they say I'm back, but I ain't go nowhere though
Been here the whole time
Where you been? You back
Matter fact, apologize

[Chorus]

[Jean Grae]
Yeah, open your mouth, say somethin, I fuckin dare you
Chokin you out 'til you can't suck any air through
Fuck with your man too, thinkin I can't do what I plan to
Vet vandal, niggaz are brand new
Ain't knew I was bad news? Look at the tattoos
Get ran through like you was fingers through Sassoon
Horror chick in the bathroom, off the backstage room
Shit you couldn't imagine, nigga I'll harass you
I'll Ras Kass you, +Soul on Ice+ and body cast dude
Past due, Jean and Kwe' the last two action heroes
Actually had the capacity, to be the ones in a class of zeroes
Hip-Hop's not dead, it was on vacation
We back, we bask in the confrontation
You can ask me, have any conversation
You talk shit, Blacksmith, Jean, I'm waitin nigga

[Chorus]

[Talib Kweli]
We not fallin for your trick cause your image is like a gimmick
Forget it every rhyme is bitten, you like a mimic
I'm talkin to the lord and I'm askin him for forgiveness
Just for kickin niggaz out the club like Michael Richards
Yeah I admit, I'm guilty, the way I spit is filthy
I keep it gritty so they get it they feel me, the flow
is known for touchin the soul of street hustlers
I speak in the language they know I keep customers
The writin therapeutic, it's due to the pain and sufferin
While these dudes get it confused and abuse the creative substance
I'm givin you a contact high, my name buzzin
And I came in the game with nothin, stop frontin nigga
Talk shit now!

[Outro - over LOTUG break again]
The year of the Blacksmith is not defined by any calendar
Just thought I'd remind all you challengers
Get the name right, Talib Kweli, BKMC, say it again

Get your hands in the air (get 'em up~!)
Put your hands in the air (put 'em up~!)
Get your hands in the air (get 'em up~!)
Put your hands in the air (put 'em up~!)

   <lyrics>
    {"I know they miss yoooooou..." - Billy Paul}

[Chorus: sampled from Billy Paul's "JUst a Prisoner"]
It seems like every-BODY, everybody, everybody
Everybody forgotten about me..
Will I ever, ever, EVER, be free?
Huh, uh, HUH?

[Lil Wayne - Verse 1ne]
Just when they thought it was safe
I picked up the phone and called it a day
I bought a new car, caught a new case - fuck it
The harder I walk, the ground shall shake
Stompin, the harder I march, the ground will break
I am, groundbreakin, like an earthquake, heh-heh
Yeah, I run this shit, but I'll tackle it
You want me to break it down, I'ma fracture it
My mind is wanderin, I can't find it
But ten times outta ten, my mind on the mon-ey
Bandana around my head like I know karate
And I'll wax a nigga's ass like Mister Miyagi
And it ain't over 'til the fat lady sang
And that bitch got a whole lot more weight to gain
And call me by my new name
(...What is that?) featuring Lil Wayne

"It seems like every-BODY, everybody, everybody
Everybody forgotten about me..
Will I ever, ever, ever, be free?
Huh, uh, HUH"

(My nigga, featuring Lil Wayne..
Came here to fuck with me tonight, shwaty)

[Scarface - Verse 2wo]
I am as, real as they come as hard as they get
They go to talkin off the wall I put a par' in they shit
I'm the o-riginal gangsta, I'll tell you how I do it
I take niggaz from the jump when they step to me with that bullshit
I am a fool, bitch, a native H-Town from the south side of Houston
You're tuned to the sounds of a nigga, who don't give a fuck
'casue one way or the other
I'm gon' still get mine, play the game, motherfucker
The truth is in the building and I came tonight
And I done sold so many records, change my name to life
'cause I can breathe into the hood, make it feel my pain
And even though they try to change me, I remain the same
And even if I did have that chrome-plated grill on my shit
I come from out the motherfuckin bricks
Now, never forget, where I come from, son
I'm respected in these motherfuckin streets I run
I'm Face

"It seems like every-BODY, everybody, everybody
Everybody forgotten about me..
Will I ever, ever, ever, be free?
Huh, uh, HUH"

(MY, NIGGA)

[Bun B - Verse 3hree]
It's Bun B, the nigga Mr. Swisher, and Mr. Flows
Mr. Brick, Mr. Killer Grams Nigga, Mr. 'BOWS
Mr. Slab, Mr. Candy Paint, nigga Mr. Dough
and Mr. Eighty-fo', hatin hoe, we think yo' sister know
When I hits the do', motherfuckers drop and kiss the flo'
Light bulb flow, I glass shatter, transistors blow
I'm the shit fo' sho! Roll wit it, bitch or {?} worm
I'm hot in this heat, a head shot'll keep your perm burned
It's my turn, I earn stripes and paid dues so
Don't be surprised if I'm in a trap or own a new show
I don't TRY snitch, sneak diss or even backdo'
Balla block, a short stop or drop down in Fat, hoe
(What!) I don't keep it a hunnid (huh), I keep it a thousand
I'm hood, so I rep the hood, direct from the public housing
(Manye!) I got it crunk like Obama in a 'Fesco
Nuttin less than the best, hoe
Nigga, let's go it's U..

"It seems like every-BODY, everybody, everybody (muthafuckin G..)
Everybody forgotten about me..                  (K, fo' LIFE!)
Will I ever, ever, ever, be free?               (Long Live the Pimp!)
Huh, uh, HUH"

    For Whom the Bell Tolls
   </title>
   <lyrics>
    [will.i.am - Intro] (Phonte)
Ready or not... (Ready or not...)
Ready or not... (Ready or not...)
Ready or not... (Ready or not...)
Ready or not... (Ready or not...)
Ready or not... - It's time to go
Ready or not... - It's time to go
Ready or not... - It's time to go
Ready or not... - It's time to go

[Phonte - Verse 1ne]
Uh..
This is my last day, this is my last era
Wifey sittin front row runnin her mascara
And I'm laid out STIFF like my last pair of
starch jeans; it seems that all my past errors
don't even matter 'cause, I ain't even mad at God
I just think the saddest part is I don't wanna go
'Cause who the hell knows for, whom the bell tolls
I was, chillin with muy peoples just, out on Melrose
with Blu and Evidence lampin in our shelltoes
Drainkin brew and tappin bitches on the el-bow
then WHOA!! - Another chapter closes well
When they start to toll, it's just yo' time to bail, yeah

[Chorus: will.i.am]
Some people live their life to die
Some people live to try, and fly, and fly sky high
Some people live their life to ride
Ride 'cause they riders, some people talk that jive
Some people live their life to lie
I live my life to open up my eyes real wide, wi-wide
Some people wanna live blind and walk the road
Oh, no - for whom the bell tolls

[Evidence - Verse 2wo]
Uh, bells and whistles, they shootin, could smell the pistols
They never EVER hit or miss - it's the real official
Bullseye target, like New Jack Carter
The harder it gets, the more I find the market off sparkin the Flint {*matches strike*}
Part of me says, "Go back home"
The other half says, "Get that throne" (y'know?)
So I spit words, they read like palms
and turn directions from East to North (oh!)
We can't stop nature takin its course
But I can report, so I stay with my hand on record
Lookin for the next future resort
to reside in a time where bell rings and people are dyin
I'll just try to escape to this place in my mind

[Chorus: will.i.am]
Some people live their life to die
Some people live to try, and fly, and fly sky high
Some people live their life to lie
I live my life to open up my eyes real wide, wi-wide
Some people wanna live blind and walk the road
Oh, no - for whom the bell tolls

[Blu - Verse 3hree]
Aiyyo, ashes to ashes and dust to dust
R.I.P. Jay Dee, DJ Dust - this was us
Ah, back when it was cool to bust, picture us
Eighty plus, surrounded by the crowd wit'out a mic to clutch
Years passed and now and then I light it up
Reflect and get inspired by the fire that's inside of us
Dealin with the yadda-yadda, by-the by-the business
try to ditch ya like economy
(Why?) 'Cause John wasn't about to be politick-in (maaaan)
It's the middle of '08 and I still ain't heard Obama speak
'bout problems that we face, I'ma tryna get this cheese
'Cause you never know, who shall tolls the bell's toll folk
Young folks are old folks, when it's time to go, it's time to go, folks
Stroke, croaks, cloats, and ghost
I hold hope, blow faith in your face then fade home like..

[Chorus: will.i.am]
Some people live their life to die
Some people live to try, and fly, and fly sky high
Some people live their life to ride
Ride 'cause they riders, some people talk that jive
Some people live their life to lie
I live my life to open up my eyes real wide, wi-wide
Some people wanna live blind and walk the road
Oh, no - for whom the bell tolls

[Outro - will.i.am]
Some people wanna live blind and walk the ro-
Some people wanna live blind and walk the ro-
{SOME PEOPLE WANNA LIVE BLIND AND WALK THE ROAD
OH, NO - FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS}

[Evidence]
E-v..Blu
Khyrsis on the beat..
Phonte, uh, for whom the bell tolls..
Uh...Hello, will...
Waddup, will?
Haha...Uh, for whom, the bell tolls..
They say when it's your turn to go, it's your turn to go
So we gon' turn to music up real loud
Think about all of our people...for whom the bell tolls
George Carlin...Norman Whitfield, Isaac Hayes...

    Get Ignorant
   </title>
   <lyrics>
    [Intro]
You try to get success directly
But there is one, to destroy us
Sometimes the way is out of reach
Perhaps you may get, ignorant

[Verse One]
Do I gotta get it ig'nant and show my pigment on the job?
Slap the darkest part of my hand across jaws
These days and times with jobs hard to find
You gotta work a salt mine or work an assault 9
Most folks barely stayin afloat through proper channels
And thank the rich sheik with black camels and slaughter mammals
They run the globe with mind control in designer sandals
But life's a skinny bitch, it's a struggle to get a handle
I'm about to just +Break Bad+ like Malcolm's dad
Be meth-Boyardee with a lab and a yellow cab
So I could get the white picket fence and yellow lab
That A-merican dream makes me wake up and scream
It consists of old money buyin shiny new things
Ttat I'm about to break cause I'm creatin a scene
You can use as an anthem for Kanye's tantrums
Cause I'm about a thumb and a finger away from snappin
Damn it!

[Chorus]
Get ignorant
Get ignorant
Sometimes the way is out of reach
Perhaps you may get, ignorant

[Verse Two]
I'm early e'ry day, never took a vacation
Through mandatory overtime I always stayed patient
Through all the petty dramas I'm calmer than a sloth
But the shit don't change like if Obama woulda lost
I done worked my ass off about twenty-eleven years
And I'm usually far from anything that Heaven fears
But I'm feeling off-kilter, I ain't about to kill ya
but I am about to loosen up this filter, here's you
jerkin off to Halle Berry on the shitter (no!)
Then firin a nigga cause he's checkin on his Twitter (no!)
You mad cause ain't nobody taggin you in all the pictures (NO~!)
Well here's a good one of you taggin your wife's sister
like that!! (NO~!) I've been knowin ways to fight back
Vimeo of you sayin that you don't like blacks
Clearly though, full HD and in stereo
Your network's got holes my dude, cheerio!
I'm out this bitch

[Chorus] + [dub interlude]

[Verse Three]
Look...
Success is just a target, it could push us to the edge
Put in our heads at an early age like the pledge
Give our allegiance while you editin your souls
Won't tell you 'til you're gone that all that glitters ain't gold
But we love to watch 'em race, love to watch 'em chase dreams
So dirty, ain't a cycle that you can make clean
Got the athletes juicin, singers gettin naked
The rappers spendin all they money 'fore they even make it
Actors scared to age, shootin acid in they faces
Slaves to the ratings, every show is more tasteless
Faithless as angels cutting wings from they scapula
to trade it all in and be Dracula?!

[Verse Four]
Genocide in East Africa, but you watchin Battlestar Galactica
Fillin up the data in the back of yo' digital camera
Taking glamorous, shots of yoo' mammaries
surrounded by Vanity Fair magazine
and stuffed animals, in the house your parents paid for
Built by hand on land people slaved for
Get ignorant, stay ignorant in fact
Get belligerent, if you feel my sentiment attack
Keep kickin it, screamin for yo' sense of entitlement
Flip me off with the same hand you hold the Bible with
All that Botox, every cream, every vitamin
Can't cover up the ignorance that's inside of you
I wouldn't lie to you
It can't cover up the ignorance that's inside of you

   <lyrics>
    [Intro: Mr. Chernak]
Life will let you get away
With somethin for a while
Sooner or later, you will pay the price
When you get the bill? Heh, don't be shocked
Don't act like you don't understand
Everything you do in life causes the effects
That you experience, and when you get that bill
Be prepared to pay
When the moment of wreckoning comes
You may feel as if you unable to forgive yourself
You may be too proud, to ask for forgiveness
There may be no way you can make amends or restitutions
In the worst case scenario, you may be faced with all of these
Posibilities, at the same, time
And should that happen, remember this
Life knows what you capable of
The only reason life has taken the time
To point out your shortcomings
And nasty habits, is that life wants you to act like you know who you are
This is called Self Support, Self Care and Self Love
Until today, you may not of have realized
That you have allowed others to be involved
In a crime against you, you may have allowed them
To support you and sacrificing yourself
And believing that you are helping or serving them
Just for today, don't be a yes person
Take care of yourself, don't give what you have, for what you need
Be supportive and self loving enough
To say no, and in the words of the master, Malcolm X
Asa lama lakum, my brothers

[Chorus: T-Bird]
Why must all my good brothers go
I'm asking God, that's the question I want to know
Know, know, so I'm asking him why
I think about you, while these tears is in my eyes
But I know God got a soldier in the sky
Sky, sky, shorty's gon' be alright

[Fes Taylor]
Coming from Jersey, got the word, La's gone
House Gang CD on, pumping La's song
I think back, we was on tour
You was rocking my chain, I was rocking yours
Made me feel kinda strange, I can't even cry
Maybe cuz I'm used to hearing my people's die
Another casualty of war, but actually
I don't understand, so I'm asking the Lord
Is it all law, treated like dogs on all fours
Pain like you caught in the beartrap and lost paws
Take a short pause, and reminisce
Pain make me wanna forget, so my memory limited
How you finish it, we just beginning it
My homey's died for this, so I'm living it
Y. Million, wish I could bring him back to
I think it's time for my Loose Linx tattoo

[Chorus]

[Inspectah Deck]
How do I say goodbye? When I just said hi
When I just saw you riding by
When I just said those nights was fly
Now I look at your seed, and I see you when I look in his eyes
How can I be the same?
Knowing one day it's my turn to leave the game
I try to find ways to ease the ways, keep it dripping
Sipping VSOP, cuz my team is slain
While I'm writing, tears soaking the page, I'm so in the rage
I'm so in a daze, I'm still in denile
I'm blowing my haze, I can't get no higher, I'm going insane
If you can hear me and you watching me now
Give me a sign, something I can see now
Aiyo, I'm struggling to make it out of the hood, son
Damn, they took another good one

[Chorus]

[Hue Hefna]
Life crazy, amazed to have you puzzled
Head high, so I stand above my troubles
I sit and build with myself
Obama's right, change is better for your health
First it started wit the crabs in the barrel
My path straight, it used to be a little narrow
I had to make my circle tighter
No snakes allowed or crabs in my cypher
Still I'm praying for my homey's in the system
It's kind of hard, trying not to fall victim
Shine brighter than the sun, this is my solar system
Ninety degrees, flow sharper than a prism
Pain is more fuel to the fire
To get me closer to them things I desire
Trying to cool off cuz I'm moving through the fire
Life better than trees, gets me higher
I had to put a leash on my anger
Shit is crazy, rest in peace to La Banga
Another soldier gone but not forgotten
The truth will always shine, we get it popping

    So Much Better
   </title>
   <lyrics>
    [Childish Gambino]
I'm cooler than an ice cube, yeah I'm rude
'Bout to get your head sliced, yeah I'm nice, and you 'bout to pay the price
Like The Price Is Right, but I'm not Bob Parker
Yes, I get down like I'm Charlie Parker
Meaning that I'm musically inclined, if you try to get with mine
I'm about to blow yo' head back
Get another bullet and I spray bullet (bullet)
And I spray back, pop, pop, click, click (drop, drop) down
Now they lookin for your body like all over the town
Niggaz, my name Gambini, I used to be clean
Now I'm dirty martini, cause this +Boy Met World+ like +Feeny+
These niggaz make wishes like genie
Nigga you know how we do, latinos, black people, and gringos
This money stained my fingers like Cheetos
Blast it out your speakers like Quito
'Cause I can barely hold it all in like Speedos
These niggaz got a lot of nerve these niggaz got a lot of speaks
And all these skinny bitches busy shop at Anthropologie
Who you tryin to be? I'mma take my girls to BIM and treat 'em like a V.I.P.
Because I am a G, uhh (G, uhh)
I start the party like Chex Mix
Put it in your house like Netflix
Beat, nigga, it's what's for breakfast
Y'all niggaz got beef with this kid
Y'all niggaz' punks and stay punks like The Misfits
I'm way off in the distance, y'all done lost the race like McCain
But like McCain, you used to be cool but now you lame
It's hard to maintain ain't it? Because
I am so much better (than before)
My swag is so sick, you might catch it
I'm tired of fuckin 'round with little kids like I'm Brad Pitt
These little kids need to play in traffic
Cause all they was was make a nigga giggle like Mad Libs
I'm hot like an attic, in the summer
And girls scream "sick boy" like we know each other
But we don't know each other, you ain't my fucking brother
We need to separate like organic peanut butter
My lightsaber flashin, my kneecaps ashy
And girls of the world used to walk right past me
Now I hang with girls like my girl Kate Perry
I might have to +Mary+ +Kate+ like my name +Ashley+
These rappers don't know what they up against
They can't see a nigga like my names Snuffleupagus
If you don't like my shit, why the fuck you bumpin this?
I am so much better (than before)
You better get it clean cause this is the last straw
And break inside house and leave your gas on
Nigga, we NASA, cause we 'bout to blast off
Go in the bathroom we see you peein like I'm Shasta McNasty
Get it? UPN? Shasta McNasty?
Nigga, I'm a master, and I'm fuckin plastered
I don't need a fuckin beat for this, I can make my shit up
While I go, here's the part, that I'm about to show ya
I'm the best cause I gotta, +The Devil Wears Prada+
And he's got a boom boom like Welcome Back, Kotter
Leave your guy like my daughter, got cheese like frittata
Greed and filata got ya mama
Most rappers want the drama, but I don't want the drama
I just want a quiet night down at Benihana
I rap cause I gotta, dude's got nada
I make 'em all proud like my middle name Obama

    One Mo Time

   <lyrics>
    (*talking*)
So you getting married tomorrow huh
Congratulations, hey you know I always be trying to look out for ya
And just so you, can get this dick out your system
And you don't commit adultery, or nothing like that
Why don't you come over here, and give me some of that pussy

[Willie D]
I keep thinking about, the first time that we fucked
I was just six inches, you was a B cup
Fuck all night, in your mama's bed
Yes we did, like Obama said
Never kiss and tell, but I told my homie Craig
Ain't nothing sweeter, than being between your legs
Dicking you up, in the center of the room
And riding that ass, like a witch on a broom
Your groom ain't freaky, like me down there
I'm well rounded with the lint game, dude's a square
But this time tomorrow, you'll be walking the isle
And I'ma be the reason you smile, I'm speaking on it right now
But I'll forever hold my piece, at the ceremony
Feel that shit, bring back memories don't it
Love it, when you do the cowgirl in reverse
You getting married, let me leave you alone but first

[Hook]
I just wanna fuck you, one mo' time
For old time's sake, let a nigga knock you down
I'ma hit it, till you damn near start crying
I'ma hit it, till you damn near start crying
Ain't nothing wrong, with a little bump and grind
And if your man tripping, you know I'll be around
Hit you with a pound of the meat, from behind
Hit you with a pound of the meat, from behind

[Z-Ro]
Your booty look like, two butterball turkeys
But I'm not going in, I don't do butterball surgery
Just giving you a compliment, you know I love your bowlegs
Married in your mind, but them Ro titties and Ro legs
Bet you when you walking down the isle, in the back of your mind
You gon' be reminiscing, about how I hit it from behind
So don't cheat yourself, treat yourself
You civilized around him, around me you can be yourself
Cause I'ma be me, and me is real freaky deaky
You gon' think you peed on yourself, leaky-leaky
Homeboy glasses ain't looking right, he think he can see me
Knock his ass out, rings point bailbonds gon' have to free me
When I get out, I'ma go shit shower shave
Gators on my feet, Polo on my body sharp as a blade
Tomorrow, you gon' have a different last name
So before the sun rise, open up your thighs let me do my thang

[Hook]

[Willie D]
I went and caught ya, at your bacholorette party full of wine
Hit you with a pound of the meat, from behind
Spot you at the hotel, putting on your wedding dress
And send you to the church house, with dick on your breath
It's Willie D chump, that's what it be hump
You trying to put on lock, I got the key fuck
I'm harder than a tree stump, baby
And one mo' nut, and it's all gravy

[Z-Ro]
We was some nasty lil' ol' ass kids, cause we would do it anywhere
Back then you barely had booty, but it was still up in the air
And I was standing all up in it, working up a sweat
Go on marry that nigga, but I'm the nigga you won't forget
When y'all be in the bed, I know you don't be satisfied
I know you a nympho, he don't even know you have that side
To him, you just a bad bitch with a job
You give vegetarian head, dick is corn on the cob

   <lyrics>
    [Chorus]
I want it all
I want the cars and the fancy things
I want the life this success shit bring
I want the love and the power and respect
That's the way it seems
Said I said I want it all-ah-ah-all-ah-oh-all, ah-ah-oh
I said I want it all-ah-ah-all-ah-ah-all, oh-oh oh-oh-oh

[Saigon]
Okay; I wanna ball like LeBron or Chris Paul
But what I want even more is to finally get in the door
I want the critics to give me the credit that I deserve
Wanna show 'em how vicious a nigga is with the verve
Want the Burger King burger with the McDonald's fries
Want the Marriott but wanna save money so it's the Econo Lodge
I want people to see that I was poppin way before Entourage
Flow you can not describe
I wanna know if my sister fuckin if she protected
I want that President Obama to get re-elected
I want the kind of rhymin I'm doing to be accepted
Since my rhyme was silent at times I'd probably be rejected
I want... longevity
I want Saigon to be strong as I'll ever be, when I'm going on 70
I want mom's recipe for sweet potato pie
It was to die for, I want a reply y'all

[Chorus] w/ minor variations

[Saigon]
(I want it all) I want the Beamer, Benz and Bentley
Even though that I know they come with jealousy and envy
I want people to be honest even when it offends me
Unless they wanna wake up the violence that's deep within me
I wanna thank everybody that want the dark to shine
I wanna earn the true dollar sign without doin blue-collar crime
I want you and you to learn how to rhyme
You can't call yourself an emcee if you're just spewin the five'n'dime
I want the kids in the ghetto to go to school
by the multitude; want them to know that flunkin is so uncool
I wanna know who's relatin gangbangin with entertainment
Probably the same dude that'll be the complaintant
I want the paintings, y'all could buy up the jewelery
I want hip hop to stop providing this buffoonery
I want the opportunity, I promise on mommas I won't stall
I'm telling you pah~!

[Chorus] w/ minor variations

[Saigon]
(I want it all) I want to send a rest in peace to Mr. Mass Appeal
I wanna feel if Nicki Minaj ass is real
I wanna know if you dangerous or a daffodil
Like do you want this machete or want this Massengil?
I wanna welcome myself back into rap
Y'all can clap or have an asthma attack
As a matter of fact, I want everybody imaginin that
I was the one out of the pack that ain't go staggerin back
(Say it again) I wanna welcome myself back into rap
Y'all can clap or have an asthma attack
As a matter of fact, you think I came this far
for me to motherfuckin fall? Hell naw!

    Whn the Lights Go Off

   <lyrics>
    [Intro: Redman]
Uhh
I'm ready, I'm ready.. (yeah!)
I'm ready (what's up?)
I'm ready (what's good?)
I'm ready (you know I'm feelin real high)
I'm ready..
I'm ready (I'm ready)
I'm ready (I'm good)
I'm ready (let's go!)

[Poo Bear]
When the lights (lights) go off (go off)
You're feenin once you had a chance
That's why I (I) just (just) can't (can't) leave it alone
Ohh, ohh, ohh, ohh

[Redman]
Gilla House niggaz! Yo
Hip-Hop has been my callin, ever since that I was crawlin
E. Sermon start recordin, 9-2 started ballin
Yeah, whoever woulda knew, a hot man like me survivin
Recession may have you down, a boy like me keep on ridin
I, I keep on ridin, New Jersey hold me down
No sense to blame Bin Laden, when the bomb right here in town
Y'all just didn't recognize, but I'm hopin now you know
Everybody tellin lies but y'all gonna feel

[Chorus: Poo Bear] + (Redman)
When the lights, go off
You're feenin once you had a chance
That's why I (yeah) just (yeah) can't, leave it alone
Ohh, ohh, ohh, ohh

[Redman]
Let's get it! Hey, yo
Some rappers say they had it, I feel I'm gettin started
Got a little bit of change in my hand, Obama's now in office
So "no" is not an option, my heart is pumpin hunger
Your money's dial tone, got it? Wrong number!
I, I need my paper, gotta keep my lights on
I'm buildin somethin major, so I can count my acres (yes!)
Better recognize, hip-hop I love it mayne
For the music I will die and y'all gonna feel

[Chorus]

[Redman]
Ha ha, yo
My boys said I done it, I told 'em I ain't finished
My skill's Bout It Bout It, but the money, +No Limit+
Gotta keep my nose in it, cause I plan to make a killin
Instead of sittin 'round, tryin to whip, makin millions
I, I love my job, I, I love my life
If, if God my witness, I feel I did it twice (yes!)
Better recognize, Reggie is goin forward
Baby when I'm lock and loaded, y'all gonna feel

[Chorus] - 2X

[Redman]
Ay, ay, ay, I'm, I'm ready
I'm, I'm ready
I'm, I'm ready (I'm ready)
I'm, I'm ready
I'm, I'm ready, can put the whole world in my hands
Yes sir, let me at you
When the lights go out, and we got a plan
I got one ready, can put the whole world in my hands
If that plan fails, I take another route
I'm always ready, when the lights go out, out, out, out
Believe me I'm always ready
When the lights go ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-out, out, out
Believe me I'm always ready, when the lights go out, out

[Chorus]

[Outro: Redman]
Watch me, watch me, watch me (yes sir!)
Reggie Noble in the buildin
(I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready)
Poo Bear on the vocal chords, what's GOOD?
King David on the track, what's happenin my dude?
(I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready)
Yeah, yeah, signin off 2025
(I'm ready, I'm ready)
We love you, we love you
(I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready)
(I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready)

    There Will Be Blood
   </title>
   <lyrics>
    (Can I do it?
Yeah!
Can y'all do it?
Yeah!
All together now
Ahhh....)

[ Celph Titled ]
If me and some rap faggot have static
We can go to war, at your show you'll need flak jackets
Strapped with automatics? No, we use bats and hatchets
Give the microphone a drug test, I spit crack at it
(For crack addicts)
Approach your A&amp;R with an A-R, based on
A true story, I spit h-bombs in every eight bars
When Tony put his face in that snow, I was writin them flavor flows
Yeah, even my worst haters know that I'm a player for sho'
They be like, "Yeah, I'm with you, Titled"
Bring bitches back to the pad like a menstrual cycle
You walk around like you some kinda thuggy guy
I know you ain't Diddy but I can make you see through Puffy eyes

[ Sadat X ]
You know my stats, boy, you know what I'm workin with
Firearms of various calibers penetrate
I'm the hate that breeds hate
Nah, let me illustrate
Time stands still on the day that's slow
With me it ain't about the show, it's 'bout the proof
I aim from the roof
Make any fatal move, this is a stick-up
You sneeze or even hiccup
You layin flat
You wanna face this rage?
Somebody throw some meat in the cage
Wear armor, you can call Obama
Call your mama
I breed armies, make men out of boys
I'm your tactical General Patton
From BK to Manhattan
You frontin, you lame
Treat your whole squad the same

[ Grand Puba ]
I don't play when it come to this
I rule the mic with the iron fist
Compile data, then I make the list
Grab the ( ? ), then empty trash so they don't exist
Since vinyl words flow like herds of rhinos
Leave your ass trampled when I'm runnin on a sample
A showdown at sundown, these verbals I run down
Will leave yo ass dumbfound, you thought you was gunned down
Rhyme style mean like a dopefiend lean
Head against the green and you face the guillotine
Grand Puba, there's no way you can dodge
Better off tryin your luck in Las Vegas at Mirage

[ A.G. ]
Been through ups and downs, never touched the ground
Like girls with the big butts never fuck with clowns
I let the music take over me, words flow through me
Truly the best, that's why niggas keep quotin me
I'm the baddest nigga livin, average niggas don't stand a chance
I danced in France, put hands and feets on beats
Put fans in trances, Amsterdam is
A place where I sin, get that yen in Japan, kid
The Swiss mountains, I got a Swiss accountant
Chick with a fountain pen keep my chips amountin
To somethin, my ground is unparalled
While y'all niggas keep on horsin around like carousels

[ O.C. ]
Yeah
Mind over... as a matter of fact
There's no practice needed, see, I'm matched by none
When it's all said and done up
The last man standin is proof
Who has the biggest brass in battles, a crafty McGyver
Everyday things round me work to my advantage
( ? ) hit the plan at random
So every livin soul on the planet understand this
As some often say, the heir is apparent
I'm that ( ? ) priceless art
There's no biddin on an auction block
Fortune of Fort Knox
Off top or written
Each vowel takes precicsion
Knockout solidifies when they fight over a decision

[ Diamond D ]
I got the flow so cold niggas call me Chilly
Don't ever press up, fam, I smack you silly
If I'm all out of dutches I pack the Phillie
On my j-o-b I mack the millies
And I'm all about stackin my chips
Gettin dome in the back of the whips
Start smackin them hips
All that slick talk'll just get you smacked in the lips
Game time fourth quarter, back to the blitz
You can't move me, shake me, break me, make me
Be somethin I'm not, niggas wanna snake me
I write by Skate Key, right in the 'X
Big Diam still writin the checks
Holla at me

   <lyrics>
    "As many of you no doubt know
This is a very special and historic night in the history of show business
No man has given more, asked less or been more needed
A decade and a half of wit, insight, knowledge and entertainment was your gift to us"

[Kam Moye]
This is the biggest moment of my life, maybe the last one I'll ever get
It's heaven scent, cause at this level now I can use every cent
The world's looking like you gon' Kobe or Chris Webber it
But I don't succumb to pressure, not ever
Every bone in my body would probably have to be broken to break me
They can't disable my greatness with label slavery
I'm stepping above it, the rap Frederick Douglas, the black
heads are gon' love it, this is freedom over break beats
I feel reborn like a Christian basking in holy water
I feel reformed like a prisoner free holding his daughter
Got an optimistic vision now when vocals recorded
Why would I stay in the past? The future's important
Boy I'm ten times better than Supastition on "7 Years..."
Visibly, you disagree, you must have Helen Keller ears
I'm heavy, I don't mean physically, I mean lyrically
And that's the reason why I keep on, cause now I feel reborn

[Chorus]
I feel incredible from head to toe
My mind's feeling better than you'll ever know
Cause I feel reborn (I'm feeling like a new man)
Back once again (Oh you thought it was over, I'm just starting)
I feel incredible from head to toe
My mind's feeling better than you'll ever know
Cause I feel reborn (And it's still Reform School)
Back once again (I ain't done)

[Kam Moye]
I've been face to face with death, placed in places that would torture most
Fortunate, the game support from Portland out to Portugal
Been blessed to be featured in the Chairman's Choice, The Source and so
Been humbled by poverty down to my last quarter bro
When record sales was horrible, some wouldn't support it bro
The ones who tried it couldn't find a local record store to go
Music's affordable, damn near free, it's portable
MP3 players to play in multitudes for the youth
Oh that's a poor excuse, think you above it kid?
My advice to pack your bags and find yourself another gig
You thinking you making paper in two-thousand-and-ten?
Two-thousand-and-eleven off of rap, bitch you out of here
Go swallow your pride and put some product in streets
The game is lacking in nutrients, they need some +Vitamin D+
Niggas ain't buying music here, why do you think that I'm overseas?
Cause those cats support the raw shit by far kid
This ain't candy-coated pantyhose and bras on the break
It's a grown man's own jam, spam can you relate?
If you hate, hell you better get ready for drama setting armageddon
Hit me with two hands like Obama taking Conga lessons
Look at me, I've gone aggressive, guess I'm still in detox
But you get the message, guess I better press the E-stop
I see people throwing up white flags yelling "please stop"
You lucky this time I don't keep on, I feel reborn

[Chorus]
I feel incredible from head to toe
My mind's feeling better than you'll ever know
Cause I feel reborn (It's like a breath of fresh air to me)
Back once again (I'm loving that, bring it back one more time)
I feel incredible from head to toe
My mind's feeling better than you'll ever know
Cause I feel reborn (Alright, that's enough for me)
Back once again

    As Small as a Giant
   </title>
   <lyrics>
    [Intro: Big K.R.I.T.]
See, I was made in my father's image and they belittle my deeds
Their lustful convictions pledge allegiance to the almighty power and greed
See, seeds born withered, parents still children, adolescent in their ways
Some preachers false prophets, educated pigeon droppers using our sins to get paid
Slaves, give them freedom, but give them dope
Take away their leaders cause that gives them hope
Sell them dreams of changing things like they were never kings and queens befo'
As small as a giant

[Chorus]
As small as a giant, I'm still riding
Hand on my sword, Good Lord I need time
Watch for the sun-eaters blocking our shine
Enlighten my kind, reason for rhyme
I'ma find Zion, free my soul
Repent for all the things I done till my eyes close
When the boat man come I'm paying my toll
Outside the gates of Heaven, pray to God I'm chose
As small as a giant

[Big K.R.I.T.]
The beginning's kinda dark, not too soft, fairly hard
Drenched with love from my mother, connected to her struggle
till she cut me loose, now what shall I do?
It was all so easy, look at how they treat me ever since she pushed me through
Now put me back in, stop these contractions
Water breaking, aw damn, I know it's bout to happen
Failed events, no picket fence, a dream deterred
Bending liquor, chilling with my niggas, swishers and herb
Eviction notices, hopelessness thrown on my shoulders
God won't give you more than you can handle, carry these boulders
Give it all I got until I get older
Couple of medals on my sleeve cause life made me a soldier
Reminisce on how it was way back when
when some thangs were better off way back then
As small as a giant, a promise so divided
Probably ain't surprised in so long since we sung songs over large campfires
Cosbi was cool, but television is a lie
Some reason I relate to Survivor
Fresh Prince with no Uncle Phil
The Carlton that I knew never stayed where we lived, couldn't play with those kids
While they was reading books, we was playing cops and crooks
While they was writing essays, I was writing hooks momma
I'll be that nigga on TV
cause people like Bow Wow and Soulja Boy make it look easy
No pun intended, hoping they get offended
I'm throwing up if these niggas spitting
Didn't write it, but recite it like puppets on strings
Belittled as a peasant, but my bloodline is of kings
Knight in shining armor for this rap shit, I slash quick
towards a man's beard, leaving gashes on these industry bastards
They can't see what is real, don't know how I feel
They weren't raised where I live, in Mississippi

[Chorus]

[Big K.R.I.T.]
Rise and shine, no time for sleep, thinking bout eating
Leaving this place, long gone
I get no service on this earth, I need to phone home
Did too much dirt to talk to God, nowadays I get the dial tone
Try again tomorrow, my heart filled with sorrow
My family broke too, so why bother trying to borrow?
No car, no house, drug dealing, feeling like it might be
my only option to get meals, what else could I do?
Put yourself in my shoes
If you had no whip, you'd take some shortcuts too
There ain't no time to be wasted, the world is going under
Nowadays can't tell fall from spring and winter from summer
I wonder if this was meant to be
Maybe all the bullshit was meant for me, it takes a lot of energy
Break these chains, erase these thangs society put up on our brain
How could I explain it? We ain't free yet
Obama cool, but he ain't sending me no free checks
They killing all my niggas, Lord forbid I'll be next
Not now, got too many sorrows to say and kisses to give
They don't feel how I feel, they weren't raised where I live, in Mississippi

[Chorus]

    Sweet
   </title>
   <lyrics>
    ("You look so sweet, so.." "You look so sweet..")

[Intro: Common]
Yeah...
Y'know they be askin 'bout Common, where he at?
What that man doingnow?
I'm doin what I do -- hip-hop
That's what I do
Yeah

[Common]
How can I say this? Fuck it, I'm the greatest!
I am the A-list for all these great debaters
A lot of y'all nah-now, forgot now who I am
The '87 nigga used to rah-rah in the jam
Ah YEAH~! We put them things in the air
When I drop a single, it's really like a pair
of Air Jordans, important to the culture
If you ain't true to it, Â¡cÃ¡llate la boca!
Get my drink on like a coaster
Post up on the wall that Mike used to live off
Hip-Hop Master Cleanse and I'ma get my shit off
Rollin in a Maserati Gran with the lid off
I bit all like a monster, live nigga this is my encore
Encore, encore, I rhyme for the Commoners
My name synonymous with prominence
I'm to Hip-Hop what Obama is to politics
Common is...

Yeah!
Man, y'all niggaz man, you soft mother...
Yeah my man, motherfucker!
Man, come around my crib, you know where I'm from
Some hoe-ass niggaz
Singin all around here man, "La-la-lah," all that
You ain't no motherfuckin Frank Sinatra (Uh..)
Lil' bitch! Yeah, this the raw right here
This the raw right here, nigga!
Sweet motherfucker! Sweet-ass bitch motherfucker!

Wa-da-da, da, wa-dada-dada-dang!
The C-O double-M O-N, I'm not playin!
Da-da man at work, I make my own lane
I'm the franchise so I rock my own chain
Know I said give 'em that 80s' Cocaine
Somethin raw, somethin pure so I stayed in that vein
The hero that he know, that he cold like when it's
below in the Geo, wipe ya feet off in the Regal
I'm king, observe the throne AND the dream
I have it, +Supreme+ like +Mathematics+
Yeah, a breath of fresh air for you asthmatic rap addicts
Pro-black magic, this is semi-automatic
Rap, it won't jam in traffic
The game need direction, I'm here to map it, uh~!
Uh, some people say that they be missin creativity
But when it come to hip-hop, it begins and ends with me -- SWEET

[Outro: Common]
Y'know... y'know man, you should know where I come from
You should know who I am, nigga!
MAN, you know! You should never wanna go against me
You know man, you too soft for that, man!
I-I be seein you man, I see it in yo' eyes, man!
You ain't the type of nigga that could go against me!
You get in my presence you gon' feel like a lil' hoe!
You ain't a man yet, you tryna be somebody else!
MAN, BE YOURSELF, MAN!
You come around my crib, you get yo' shit took, HUH~!
Wherever you go, you probably be overseas in Europe and get yo' shit took
Youse a hoe! You know you sweet!
Ain't nothin you can do man, people see that man
Broads be seein you sweet!
Done wit you muh... it's over for you
It's over for you! It's OVER! Sweet motherfucker..

    Telescopes
   </title>
   <lyrics>
    [Chorus] [Reks]
Why you wanna roll them Dice?
Don't you wanna see what Hope brings?
Careful before you wReck your life
See through my, telescope eyes
I can see the future, I
I can see the future
When a change gon' come?
When a change gon' come?
I'd like to share with your telescopes

[Verse One] [Reks]
Peace to my niggas livin' oh so hood
Rest in peace too early cause they know no good
I know shit ain't democratic in our demographic
The wars on outside, the streets tragic
Street's average, about a, kill in a minute
Don't need to see overseas death, we livin' in it
In tenement climates, violence or business
Jails higher the death tolls, cops hire to witness
Reason why so many kids is gettin' buried
They all carry same heat cops on beats carry
We don't need momma worried
Shit ain't necessary
We need new leaders, modern revolutionary
The revolution televised, should we be surprised?
Rather watch Flavor Of Love than realize
Pre-Armageddon happenin' right before our eyes
Technology disconnect me from outside

[Chorus] [Reks]
Why you wanna roll them Dice?
Don't you wanna see what Hope brings?
Careful before you wReck your life
See through my, telescope eyes
I can see the future, I
I can see the future
When a change gon' come?
When a change gon' come?
I'd like to share with your telescopes

[Verse Two] [John Hope]
I wipe the sweat off my dome, spit my phlegm on the beat
In the street
They fight cold wars with heat
Believe, the more drama, the more karma
It's not a myth, I was Hope before Obama
With the visions of a world where we educate the careless
I never lift weights but I raise awareness
I'm strong
My third eye see my first born quiver
Math class, harass when he first heard 'nigga'
I said, "It's not the first nor the last."
But bored in class, use your brain like a shotgun blast
And the impact will keep 'em intact when they provokin' 'em
I know it's in arms reach, society Utopian
Now how you like them apples, pears and oranges?
You didn't think that this nigga here from Providence could change the world
As I stand in the session
I'm not poor but I beg the questions
So answer

[Chorus] [Reks]
Why you wanna roll them Dice?
Don't you wanna see what Hope brings?
Careful before you wReck your life
See through my, telescope eyes
I can see the future, I
I can see the future
When a change gon' come?
When a change gon' come?
I'd like to share with your telescopes

[Verse Three] [Lucky Dice]
I can see through my telescope to right where you are
Hey, hey, hey you're a super superstar
Maybe if you believe that you are
Then you'll find that you'll go far
But you're young and you still wanna bug out
20 years later you'll find yourself strung out
Cause you made them bad choices
Them bad choices
They was just bad habits
Truthfully you could be the illest if you wanted to, that's my witness
But it's a future where nobody listens and so it stays distant
Gone and forgotten, but it could be different
To find a way to them brighter days
Use your mind it'll light the way
That's what I like to say
Too many youngins out there dyin' on a righteous day
Just tryin' to get they money right

[Chorus] [Reks]
Why you wanna roll them Dice?
Don't you wanna see what Hope brings?
Careful before you wReck your life
See through my, telescope eyes
I can see the future, I
I can see the future
When a change gon' come?
When a change gon' come?
I'd like to share with your telescopes

[Verse One: Maino] (Robbie Nova)

Somebody's girl, she probably might be one
I know a real bad bitch when I see one

Because she the kind of girl a nigga need son!
No games I'm serious I think I really like her
Oh lord she's it I'll wife her
Hopin I can get close enough to try her
Man I would lock her down, life her
'Cause she's the baddest bitch in the world
And all I think is how I'm supposed to make her my girl
Damn! I just want to get the chance to please her
Look at Jay-Z and B that could be us
You got what I need I knew it

*That could be us, be us, be us
*That could be us, be us, be us

[Verse Two: Maino]
Yeah! Come on! Yeah!

On the red carpet now my new chick famous
My dog told me lately I ain't focused now
'Cause it's clear, shorty got me open now
She really got me spinnin like a ceilin fan
I ain't in and out the clubs I'm a different man
I used to play around with the groupies yep
Met her, then I gave the groupies
Long hair, green eyes
True Religions lookin tight around her mean thighs
I ain't trippin off of what my boys said, I'm juist tryin to be her boyfriend
And you ain't got to worry about them chicks
'Cause baby, you that bitch!

[Chorus: Robbie Nova] *Maino &amp; Robbie Nova on the chorus together

   <lyrics>
    [Intro]
("Dumb rappers need teaching" - Biggie)
Okay so two rappers come out the jewelry store
with their two bling chains on, right?
And they're going to their car, it's a Mustang
And when they get they realize that they locked the keys in the car
So they're fiddling with the locks for hours trying to pick it
So suddenly the guy that owns it says
"Yo hurry up, it's 'bout to rain, and I left the top down!"
{*crowd laughter*}

[Chorus: Random]
Yeah I know that I posess the rhyme
to stretch your mind with beats by Hexsagon
We gon' ROCK to the rhythm, ROCK to the rhythm
Don't STOP 'til it hit 'em, word
And plus I got the streets and the cons and the geeks and the dons
on the beats and the rhymes if you seek you can find
We gon' ROCK to the rhythm, ROCK to the rhythm
Don't STOP 'til it hit 'em, word, yes sir~!

[Random]
Yo, who get the lump sums while these rappers bump gums?
The frame I drop is front page like a bus plunge
Tryin to put a little some some'n in the trust fund
and at the same time just have some fun
I wonder what'd happen if Maya and Koji Kondo
made a baby in the 80's that studied the rhyme flow
of KRS, then went off to college at the same time
played Final Fantasy and left 1-Up to 99
At the shows I get pounds and handshakes
I call 'em my family, you call 'em a fanbase
Ran makes music people can relate to
I looked in the mirror when I was young it told me stay true
Whack shows from Ran are like Nokia
No matter how hard you look, you won't see it
Cal Ripken of spittin, no days off
I can't afford to be missin
And alla y'all thugs with computers look foolish, we rule this
You kick-ass rappers are shoeless and just clueless
Lurkin in the forums just to see who responded
Constantly upping your posts so folks can comment
Man that's nonsense, scoff and I watch
When you do blow up reserve a spot on your jock
In the meanwhile gotta make 'em scream loud
Critics I have you like John Coffey, walkin +A Green Mile+
The Rock

[Chorus]

[Random]
In the name of the most magnificent, Ran rippin it
Antithesis of the whack, mad different
I come off like a toupee, touche
You DVD and I'm Blu-Ray, the new way, excuse me
I go in like a Jordan fadeaway
Yeah I'm direct deposit and payday's a day away
You can pretend to be ahead of me mentally
but the penalty is death or a similar injury
I don't spit them kiddie rhymes, claimin that they killin time
How they really grind, shut up and gimme mine
My level of skills ahead of the field
I raised the bar in oh-SIX now competitors kneel
No swears I ain't tryin to go there
Battlin Ran is walkin on a treadmill, you ain't goin nowhere
And no there, is no one testin this
So go 'head, take a razor to your necks and wrists
and kill yourself

[Chorus]

[Random]
Aiyyo, I don't brag a lot yo, but the raps is hot
So, I'ma lap the flock heh, while these rappers watch
Feel free to hit me up if the track is hot
This year alone sold more hooks than bait and tackle shops
And no additives like grandma's recipes
Heavenly that will be measurin me for they effigies
Sayin it isn't dope? Then you ain't listen close
College professors put my biggest quotes on sticky notes
They used to clutch they purses when I walked by
Now they smile when I stunt like +The Fall Guy+
Me of all guys, I dig in the archives
Spit a verse, split the game up like apartheid
Hard to think about kids with my persona
I could birth the next Obama or Jeffrey Dahmer
Bowlin for dollars, better stay in your lane
Cause we all from the gutter and they ain't playin no games
So we strike late night when nobody is there
Split shifts so nobody is spared, then we outta here
Yeah, knew you wasn't 'sposed to touch it
Me and Hexsagon, now we 'bout to blow the budget
What?

    [Chorus: Ryan Leslie]
Shorty you precious.. and you gon' love how I put it down (yeah)

No hesitating.. cause I got what you're lookin for.. (Oh yeah, yeah)
And I got one word.. one word to describe ya..
Ohh, you're precious

[Rap: Jim Jones]
(Uh.. Jones)
Whoa, whoa, shorty
You know you precious (Sexy)
Hands down a little more then impressive..(Such a diva)
You could afford to be selective..
If you've got a man he needa be over protective.. (He betta watch out)
No game just telling you my perspective..(uh huh)
I would try to scoop you if I didn't even direct..(Without a deal)
She'll leave a nigga breathless, now who you came with is who they say you done left with.. (Jones)
You got a love her, every the morning you got breakfast
And she don't be goin through my phone like no detective (Babe)
Seeing me with you got them sicka than asbestos (Oh)
You aint gotta love it they gotta fuckin respect it..(You betta do that)
If I were you, I would get up on some neck shit
If I send the goons out somebody's gonna make an exit (Bird game)
She come and get me if I get arrested..(Oww)
lil' mama do the unexpected.. (Uh huh)
Cause Shorty's she's a ridah.. (Such a ridah)

[Chorus: Ryan Leslie]
Shorty you precious.. and you gon' love how I put it down (yeah)
I see you watching.. so let's not mess around (no)
No hesitating.. cause I got what you're lookin for.. (Oh yeah, yeah)
And I got one word.. one word to describe ya..
[ Jim Jones Lyrics are found on www.songlyrics.com ]
Ohh, you're precious

[Rap: Jim Jones]
Every Obama needs a Michelle.. (A first lady)
So little mama won't you be my Michelle..(Uh)
Michelle, my belle, I want you on my team.. can't you tell.. (Uh huh)
Wanna buy you pretty things like bags from Chanel..
Texting on the phone I got you laughin on your cell.. (You like that?)
SMH, LOL, with a smiley face (Nasty) talking dirty got me hotter than a fireplace.. (Go)
Whats the deal, is you tryna get baked, take you out the fridge and put your ass on broil.. (Go)
Treat you like milk I'll let your ass get spoiled.. (And?)
Said you wanna ride, I bought you brand new toys..(Take that take that)
So tell cupid that I seen my target, pretty face, and a body like a Greek goddess..(She's a dime)
A diva, closet like Neiman Marcus (C'mon) work on a new fashion before it hits the market..

[Chorus: Ryan Leslie]
Shorty you precious.. and you gon' love how I put it down (yeah)
I see you watching.. so let's not mess around (no)

Ohh, you're precious

    Skyscraper
   </title>
   <lyrics>
    People asking where I've been at
Had to see the world and put food where my fridge at
Tours all over the place, brother I did that
When I was a little cat, didn't want a car
Used to look at skyscrapers like "that's where I'ma live at"
I dreamed this, can you believe this?
It's so surreal how I'm living my achievement
It's 3 AM riding slow in my V6
Thinking why the hell it took so long to release shit?
Left turn, lanes start forming
Hit a red light as the rain started pouring
Open the sunroof, let the water come through
Leather getting wet, I don't care, cause it's just you
That's what the mirror say, I could be gone tomorrow
But since I'm here today, you're gonna hear me say
I'm changing, that ain't really fun
Change is good, though, ask any bum
Ask Obama, that was his campaign
All I'ma do is give you my last name
I'm losing friends for pursuing my career
When the music ends, will they truly be here?
I do pretend if I'll make it through the year
We can be cool again before a funeral appears
The beautifullest smear when the eulogy is near
Cause when they die, you talk them through the air
Annabel, I wish that you was here
I didn't see you go, cause I knew it wasn't fear
I go to church every week, looking stupid in the chair
Cause I'm taking enough space, I be waking up late
Walking in like I own that placing my faith in the grave
Next to you, I'm crazy like Mas-on Betha
Under mad pressure
Me and God ain't talk, cause I'm scared of the lecture
Now my mom is happy I'm not bummy
I'm on, so I automatically got money
Now she attached to me, she's stressing me out
Ayo, Jay this what success is about?
Wrestling doubt, call me Hulk Hogan with this dope flowing
They all hoping I'll drop, but I don't know owing
I got too much heart for the bypass
Can't be touched, I ain't a iPad
My feet talk to the concrete every morning
I run the streets, doing push-ups on every corner
They think I'm lazy cause my content got smaller
When I've gone farther than my father, why bother?
I was touring, recording and interviewing
But to my fans I was interluding
Typical long day, leave me alone, mang
Even right now, I'm invisible on AIM
Ducking people, tired of trusting people
Damn near had enough of people, vice versa
I felt like a funny-style groupie
Came to her, threw the word "love" around loosely
Four-letter verb had her strut around droopy
I fuck around usually, it's nothing now to me
I shut it now truthfully cause
Cause I want a a wild cutie with a subtle round booty
But it's something about beauty it lasts for a little bit
Cause if the chick dumb, not even good brain could fix the shit
Lately I want a baby, that's crazy
Maybe I'm a three-legged chair, my thoughts shaky
So I get the box then I simply watch
Me pulling out quicker than a New York City cop
Deep shit, I don't sleep, kid
Cause some of y'all think my word don't mean shit
I put on these Y-3 kicks, cruise around 96
Straight with my leased whip
Looking at the skyscrapers
Upperwest-side chaser, you can't stop my grind, player
Changed the cover of this mixtape
Almost changed the title but I can't be rivalled
That's that, scratch that, that's Factz
Soon y'all gon' be downloading the Black App
Me and my pops made up for his last act
I'm his Kid, but I don't Play, I ain't a Class Act
Team player, trying to win Steve Nash rap
If you don't assist, then I'm past that
Got my eyes to the heavens watching birds skateboard
On the clouds, like the legend Tony Hawk when he skidding
Aiming for the top of the building while I'm living
I'ma get it; I'm moving on, I'm moving on
I did this, I did that, still doing more
Battered soul, what the fuck, I been through it all
When the things gonna change? Talk to me, y'all
Trying to get a skyscraper
Dying to get a skyscraper
Got both of my eyes on a skyscraper
I'ma get it, skyscraper

    Won't Be Long
   </title>
   <lyrics>
    [Intro - Rakim - talking]
In the words of the late, great Martin Luther King
"How long? Not long" ...
Won't be long, uh huh
Uh, uh
Sing along

[Chorus - Rakim] (Tracey Horton) - w/ ad libs
(It won't be long, 'til the trouble and the struggle is gone
The hustle make the struggle get gone)
It's hard to make a move, we strugglin
Everybody hate to lose but they love to win
(It won't be long, 'til the world sings the words to our song
That way we forever live on)
Back on my grind, I'm hustlin
It's just a matter of time and I'll come up again

[Verse 1 - Rakim]
They told me hustle never prolong
But I got caught up in the struggle like a slow song (uh huh)
'Cause my love and respect for this is so strong
I question the state of hip-hop (uh), major labels, etc. and so on (uh)
The show'll go on, still fiend to get my blow on
But if it's like this, then I might quit
But hold on (uh), this can only go wrong but for so long (uh huh)
Get right quick or I might flip
Try to keep a tight lip, not to complain
Ramblin, mind scramblin 'cause patience ain't blockin the pain (uh uh)
Mic sick, lyrics is still locked in the brain (uh huh)
Like Mike Vick sittin in jail watchin the game (uh)
I wait 'til the day I can play my position (yeah)
Or should I say the die I obey my addiction (uh huh)
Then complete my legacy (uh)
Without compromisin my artistic integrity (come on)

[Chorus] - w/ ad libs

[Verse 2 - Rakim]
So when they ask where I go from here (go 'head)
The road and the goal is clear (uh) but it's so severe (uh)
Sometimes I feel like lettin go, I swear
I had setbacks my whole career (straight y'all)
Messin with my grind's like messin with my mind
But yo, I'm still breathin, so I guess it's just a sign (uh huh)
But it's meaning to the message in the lines (word up)
Some things happen for a reason like a blessing in disguise
But success was in my eyes, the shine was blindin me
The fame, a little bit of change, it took some time to see
The lesson for the wise, profit more
Time to be a record and the prize was poppin off
Finally I made a couple of moves, got my own label (got to get it)
Me and a couple of dudes, we at the dope table (let's get that money)
Took a oath to stay true, now it's an empire
Put out the new Rakim album and it's fire

[Chorus] - w/ ad libs

[Verse 3 - Rakim]
Feel like I'm back where I belong when I'm in the booth (uh)
Produce and perform at my pinnacle (uh huh)
Speak the truth in my songs and my interviews (the truth)
For the youth and my dons and my women too (uh huh)
Guap insisted, watch your business with a drama dunn (get that money)
Hustlers is where we get persona from
Gotta get it, not just wish a dollar come
We optimistic since Obama won
But these days of recession
We ain't safe yet (uh huh), pray, a paycheck away from the Great Depression (uh)
Major stressin but we wait for blessings
Long as the Federal Reserve still paper pressing
I wrote the plot for gettin this cabbage in the hood
Where the average cat can triple his status in the hood
Don't stop, 'til we livin lavish in the hood
I'm like Barack with The Stimulus Package in the hood

[Chorus] - w/ ad libs

[Outro - Tracey Horton] - w/ Rakim ad libs until fade
It won't be long, 'til the trouble and the struggle is gone
The hustle make the struggle get gone
It won't be long, 'til the world sings the words to our song
That way we forever live on

    Message in the Song
   </title>
   <lyrics>
    Yeah
(There's a message, the song that I'm sing) New York City
(There's a message, the song that I'm sing) Ghettos world wide
(There's a message, the song that I'm singing)
It's the evil things that people do
The illegal dreams that we pursue
We don't think that we could lose
Ya'll know what my purpose is
I spit verses, to lift curses off my dead president worshippers
Back where the surface is, gangsters and murderers
Making money made us merciless
It's the birth of the streets, it's over they said
Rappers crossover they dead
I spit my verse with technique, 'til they knowing their ledge
First it's too deep, then I'm over their head
He too lyrical, and too subliminal
Everything from spiritual to criminal
It's a message in the bottle, open it
It's a lesson in survival, cope with it
It don't make sense to die, for the root of evil
It get too cerebral, when that ? is legal
Either way it's hell, I can't save the world
But I can show them how to save themselves from the
Evil things that people do
The illegal dreams that we pursue
We don't think that we could lose
Call it cheese or cream or green or blue
It's the root of evil we done proved
It's supreme, from me to you
I see through the eyes of the prophets, King Tutankhamuns
And Martin's and Malcolm's, Elijah Muhammad's
Wise and with knowledge
Paid in full ain't just the size of the pockets
It's rise where the top is, rise economics
I'll show you that time
Is more valuable then them diamonds in your watches
You grind where the block is, you die for them dollars
What's worth more to you? Your life or your gwop is
Thugs is pitching, chicks is in the club stripping
Flipping drugs or pimping hood is blood or cripping
Latin Kings and black gorillas
Government sits back hoping either that or crack will kill us
It sound like a setup and we the victims
One out of a million will beat the system
Getting rich from flipping bricks is over with
Take your chips and go legit from the

Evil things that people do
The illegal dreams that we pursue
We don't think that we could lose
Call it cheese or cream or green or blue
It's the root of evil we done proved
It's supreme, from me to you
To my G's on the block that do what they gotta do
Don't get me wrong, I don't judge, I'm not knocking you
Guess that's what not having a job will do
People starving gotta get they dollars too
Get that gwop at night, it's a lot of strife
My advice, is don't get blinded by the light
Drug money and blood money got a price
Six feet under or 25 to life
Do a crime and you might do the time you serving
What's it worth when you do a crime and get murdered
Time is precious, time we earned it
Time to question your grind, is it worth it
It's time that we change the game
We been waiting for change, and it came (big up Obama)
Why play with death, play it safe
Do your best to stay away from the

Evil things that people do
The illegal dreams that we pursue
We don't think that we could lose
Call it cheese or cream or green or blue
It's the root of evil we done proved
It's supreme, from me to you

Evil things that people do
The illegal dreams that we pursue
We don't think that we could lose
Call it cheese or cream or green or blue
It's the root of evil we done proved
It's supreme, from me to you}

    The Rhythm Method (Move!)
   </title>
   <lyrics>
    [Verse One]
3... 2... 1
Liftoff, jetpack shoot into space
Represent the Dot 'til we're blue in the face
Fre-fre-fresher than tooth-a-paste
You know how we do in the place
The crowd accumulates when he's tunin the bass
The fiddle and guitar are removed from the case
You know it's Kenny O when it booms and shakes
You know it's our music by the movement it makes
The crowd that it draws the yearning you get to prove what it takes

[Chorus]
Move! Throw your body on the dance floor
Whether you're beginner or advanced or
Whatever you're doin it's okay - like this
So everyone do it your own way - like this
Move! Like the dude from Chappelle's Show
Let it rip like velcro
We spit non-typical flows - like this
Mile High City and it goes like this
Like this, like this, 3-2-1-4-5-6
No tellin where the beat might hit

[Verse Two]
This is out of hand like bust to blue
Leave you soundin like Rusted Root
Rots out your mouth like a busted tooth
Attention we payin who
Exempt our tax like Atreyu dude
Stayin smooth venue we playing move
When you hear the rabbit sayin to
Let 5 explain it to you

Turn to the next page when I say
And follow along like A to the B to the C
Seven piece band you gotta see to believe
Make you jump around like you needed to pee
Make noise if you wanted me to proceed
Scream like Chewbacca, off your rocker
Drink a little vodka, link Iraq, Osama
Democracy, Barack Obama
Arabic for no war with Vietnam
And it don't stop, won't quit, so, slick

[Chorus]
Move! Throw your body on the dance floor
Whether you're beginner or advanced or
Whatever you're doin it's okay - like this
So everyone do it your own way - like this
Move! Sweat got your pants warm
{*scratching sounds*} Transform
Wiggle and shake to this song - like this
Mile High City and it's on - like this
Like this, like this, 1-2-3-4-5-6
Who's ready for some more hype shit?

[Verse Three]
This is rap's last stop like Castle Rock
The 'bots blast off like an astronaut
I suppose we came to get started
Throw them bows like some angry archers
Our delivery's pedigree headed for the charts soon
Hit you in the heart like a harpoon
Like the chambers of the Wu-Tang Clan
Flobots got that Method, Man

Wanna hang with the orangutans?
Mass appeal massive bananas in hand
Kenny O got the master plan
To move your body like an ampersand
This rhythm section'll rattle the stands
Rip sheets like we battled the clan
Average bands traffic the median
We stay in the lane we're Superman

[Chorus]
Move! Throw your body on the dance floor
Whether you're beginner or advanced or
Whatever you're doin it's okay - like this
So everyone do it your own way - like this
Move! Give it to you unprotected
Cause the rhythm is the method
Get ready to get loud
Mile High City spell it out

[repeat 8X]

    That's Life 2
   </title>
   <lyrics>
    [Verse 1]
Ms. Oprah, Mr. Cosby, I am right back at your ass
With all honor, Mr. Obama, please don't walk out so fast
I got a question, got a question, got a question for you all
Why when Oscar Grant got murdered, we didn't hear a peep from y'all?
We appreciate the way you delegate for Henry Gates
But what about your people slaving in these fields everyday?
We know that House got air conditioning and the sweetest lemonade
But don't forget your color, brother, we still muthafucking slaves
And that even go for Puffy who so muthafucking paid
That he's richer than these White folks or at least that's what he say
That's what he say, that's what he say, and them petty niggas love it
Think about it, what's a rapper standing next to Warren Buffett?
Ha ha ha, now you niggas are properly enlightened
You can disregard that sell-out shit that Jason Whitlock writing
You can disregard that racist shit that Glenn Beck is reciting
I'm the leader of the gang, tell them to get a mike

[Hook]
I was born and I was raised in the U.S.A.
And I done been around the world and back, what a day
So I done seen a lot of shit and I just want to say
That Lucifer is here to stay, so bitch, you better pray
I was born and I was raised in the U.S.A.
And I done been around the world and back, what a day
So I done seen a lot of shit and I just want to say
That Lucifer is here to stay, so bitch

[Verse 2]
What I'm touching on next, you might want to leave the kitchen
Cuz I'm touching on that touchy subject that they call religion
Kind of touchy like that religion that's touching on your children
But nobody want to talk about that, touching and feeling
On topics that they touching or talking about Jesus said
They liars like they father and sixes is in their head
Bishop Long, what is up with that monkey shit on your head?
Last I checked, vanity was a sin, the Lord said
On my life, I believe you put boys off in your bed
Though some New Birthers and Catholics ain't going to like what I just said
But before you fix your mouth and try to come with a retort
Please be advised that Jesus never took a plea in court
And he never had a plane, and he never had a car
And he never had a church that was visited by stars
But he did have love for the poor and the theives
And he was in the street, kind of similar to me, nigga

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Mr. Beck, Mr. O'Reilly, Mr. Limbaugh, Mr. Hannity
How could you sell white America your insanity?
You tell them that they're different and manipulate their vanity
When truthfully, financially their life is a calamity
Otherwise they wouldn't be listening to Dave Ramsey
So they're about as broke as the people that they don't want to be
Convincing them that rich Republicans is what they going to be
So they act like Ronald Regan and like him they're awful actors
Who look up to the rich like dumb kids look up to rappers
And that's about as dumb as a +donkey+ pulling a tractor
Yes, that's a Democrat diss, I'm a detractor
So whether you vote right or vote left it's not a factor
When you ain't got no care for your health, Hey, this America
They going to put your ass in debt something terrible
So you can disrespect presidents and call them socialists
But Palin and Pelosi both going to have you broke as shit

    Salute/Sacrifice
   </title>
   <lyrics>
    [The Reverend William Burk]
Cakes in the suitcase, guns in the briefcase, jakes by the east gates
Police in they seats wait, Reverend William Burk's mind in a deep space
Cakes in the suitcase, guns in the briefcase, jakes by the east gates
Police in they seats wait, Reverend William Burk's mind in a deep space
We creates at a G's pace, for heaves sake
And for goodness grace, we burn fakes at the stakes
Throw your hands in the sky, and wave 'em side to side
Drunk funk and skunk for getting crunk to ride
Let me hear you holla homicide
She was murdered on the dance floor, more cash in the register drawer
My whole crew pay our rep in the score
We go to war for the pure for sure
To add even more law to the thought of a cure
A hula hoop was 360 degrees, shiny afro blow in the breeze
Used to scoop shabobaloop in the coupe from the green
Queen, I'm James, all through to gold women in tans
I get it down for the CREAM, I help achieve they dream

[Shavo Odadjian]
Check this shit out...
22 frames a second, paradox shift shocks
Sword swings, swift slice, serious sounds
Spectacular shine, cypher supreme, sucker divine
The curious mind, the furious who rhyme
Sustain the streets low, sacrifice slip storyline
Sicks got sight eye
Stimulate strike sonic and sudden, sophisticated souls stay stainless
Salute, spit swat, spine, subtle severe
Snow blind, subliminal signs
Speculate six superficial stereotypes, stereotypical skeptics
Epics, except swine
Skeptics, seen in septics, sick spiritual swill spend all
Spank, curious, sick, sonic, sick, super, sick, stereo, sick
Syndrome, stay stainless, sip Scotch, sophisticated
Sick sacrifice syndrome, stay stainless, sip Scotch, sophisticated
Sick sacrifice, sacrifice, sacrifice, sacrifice, sacrifice
Sacrifice, sacrifice, sacrifice, sacrifice, sacrifice

[The Reverend William Burk]
Krispy Kremes in the suitcase, laser beams in the briefcase, onion
rings for the cheapskates
Diamond rings on the finger of my baby cakes
Achozen few we only plays for the high stakes
Series of silver, swindling service decipher the suttle signals
The spinner, spindling yard on the school
A student who took who for school in a Cee Allah Rule
Dropping a jewel on this educated fool
Simulated sonar signals, space symbol, severe civil rivalries
Split brothers and sisters
Twisters and blizzards, blow the gizzards out of lizards
We sizzle wizards, ninjas, gold dentures, trenches

[Shavo Odadjian]
Sacrifice, sacrifice, sacrifice, sacrifice

[Beretta 9]
Supposed stay in school and show and study
Supplements is needed, student instead of a slack skip sleet
Slapped him in the scalp and seen ya
Soon to the sent, to vibe the streets
Man I was stupid, straight up sick, decided supreme
Story, just a real to scene
A soldier stay strapped with a sub machine
Soon to shot, subtracted, stretched out
On the sidewalk, had to be scraped with a spatula
The shit stuck to the ceiling, my skills so sick
So I must say, to what if you second, sucker

[RZA]
Okay, kay, kay
Kill cutlery knives, kill conniving kids in it
Kid crazy cookies to corrupt you kiddy kittens
Kicking off committing criminal capers, cutting Klansmen
Kid, I build Kurtis cube kite to Kansas
Cranium like axles in kings they cause brain cells
To snap crackle and pop, like Kellogg's Krispies
Colliding kaleidoscopes for visual collisions
Captain Caveman, want Colonel chicken
Cookies in a rock, Obama like Barack
OK-L-M-N-O-P-Q-R, Z-A, stop
Super sperm spray sporadic sticky semen
Soak sweet Sandra's sheets til they sexy and steaming
Still slick majestic, bless who says in they essence
Snatch the woman's socks while Metropolis stresses
Sip superior stigmas, and slang Shaolin stings
Swarms of serum, left the brain stained
Sacrifice, sacrifice, sacra-sacrifice
Sacrifice, sacrifice, sacra, sacra, sacra
I said, super sperm spray sporadic sticky semen
I soak sweet Sandra's sheets til she steaming
Still slick majestic, bless who says in they essence
Snatch the woman's socks while Metropolis stresses
Sip superior stigmas, and slang Staten Shaolin stings
Swarms of serum, leaves the brain stained
Sacrifice, sacrifice

    And I Love It
   </title>
   <lyrics>
    [MURS speaking]
Say it the same way? Ha

[Verse One]
She was only 5'2" and she loved to argue
Girl had a mouth on her
Till it went south on her
Then I had to bounce on her
Yep, clean house on her
Now she's cussin' and she's screamin' standin' out on the corner
But I love her and I miss her
It was hard to dismiss her
When I know in three days I'm gonna get back with her
Damn

[MURS speaking]
That was the wrong verse. Hold up. Hold up. Aiight
It ain't about her. It's about this

I'm talkin' sunshine, blue skies
Dress lookin' too fly
Look good, feel good
How good? Real good
Health, wealth, knowledge of yourself
Your best friend being there when you need some help
Shelter, clothing, your car when it's rollin'
Thankful for the little things, that just keep growin'
Holdin' onto memories
Forgivin' all your enemies
Lettin' go of hate so you don't waste energy
Assemblies
Field trips
Remember that realness
Usin' inner strength
To you triumph over illness
Honesty, loyalty
Somebody that will spoil me
Love my dirty drawers and treat me like royalty
Checks
Respect
Posse in effect
MURS &amp; 9th Wonder it's like B.F.F.

[MURS Speaking]
Ha, ha, ha. Best friends forever! Ha, ha, ha. Look

We watch Heroes
Euros
Checks with ten zeros
Flicks by Tarentino
Pacino
Deniro
Hugs, kisses
Love, Christmas
Knowin' you're gonna get everything on your wish list
PB&amp;J
Soft batch
Chocolate chips
Payday
Walkin' through the mall like you got a grip like

[MURS talking]
Let me get two of those. One of those. And aye, can I get some help over here?

I'm talkin' new shoes
True school
Barbecue
Soul food
Summer days
All day
No work
No school
Wu-Tang
New slang
People out to do thangs
New tattoos
The smell after new rain
3:16
King magazine
Your very first kiss
Or the first day of spring
Blings
Crushes
Cherry ice slushies
Puppies
Kitties
A pair of big...
Forgive me
Hickeys
Girls who ain't picky
One night stands
Commitments
Quickies
Las Vegas, Nevada
Hakuna Matada
Songs by Sinatra
Or Afrika Bambaatta
My God daughters
Otta pops
Swimmin' when the water's tax
Silver Hawks, Thundercats
Aye, where is 9th Wonder at?

[9th Wonder speaking]
Hey you got to put that down. Girl you can't keep...girl...Jada...quit trippin'.

I'm talkin' about Jordan, Jada
The crib Winston, Salem
Duke, the Dodgers, them Florida Gators
Beaches
Peaches
Victoria's Secret
Donuts
Pancakes
9th Wonder teachin'
Burgers
Cheese cake
Fruit with no pesticides
You and your auntie doin' the Electric Slide

[MURS speaking]
C'mon baby, you know you can go. It go one, two...ha ha.

I got love for my momma
For survivin' all the drama
And I'm hopin' that the world fall in love with Obama
My first pair of Jordans that I bought when I was 21
All my money, not dependent on anyone
Care Bears
Apple Jacks
Runnin' Man
Cabbage Patch
G.I. Joe and any show that came on after that
Cadillacs
Old schools
Rainbows
No rules
Waterfalls
Sun rays
Football Sundays
Three day
Weekend
Sleep in
Monday
A five hour flight
Touchin' down on the runway
Livin' out desire
Clothes fresh out the drier
Seein' my name when they handin' out fliers
Shows when they sold out
Girls when they hold out
Girls when they give it up
Money, when I get a cut
Walkin' in the crib see your new born sittin' up
One love, one life, c'mon y'all, live it up

[Sample]
When you love it
So glad darlin' baby

    Homage to Dilla

   <lyrics>
    {"Sound, without focus... is just.. noise"}

[Frank Nitt]
Dilla...Slum Villa...
Focus... boy Nitty..
It's real special right now...
Feel good, don't it?
Feel like I just wanna...
Talk to my homeboy...
He ain't here right now, but he here right now (...feel me?)

Aiyyo waddup, my nigga? It's ya boy Furda
I'm workin hard, I'm givin 'em bloody murda
Keepin the dream alive, y'know just how we talked about it
We smoke hella blunts, know the vision never clouded
Seems like I'm out with Illa every other week
Swear to God, you'd be there when he rappin over beats
Niggas, we tryna get it, the legacy won't fall
That's why I started up the label and put out The Concert Hall
Done by me and RJ, Uncle Craig is nasty
on the keys and I got the B'z in ashtray
And y'know we still smoke that la to the lah
And I still know you watchin, so a nigga blowin high
And me and Dank fly, away and we play the..
songs that we made up, you keep ya niggas paid up
It's Scrap's phone ringin, I heard they lookin for me
'Cause I continue to give the people what Dilla taught me
And that's real spit, and I'ma end it there (yeah, yeah...)
Frank Nitt, signin off and I'm outta here
Outta here

[Illa J]
Look James, you already know
We is incredible, got that {?} blown
You know we be butta, 'cause we on the roll
And I'm protectin the alien code don't nobody know
But did you know, your boy Com datin Serena
In movies with Angelina; Beyonce basically is the new Tina
O-O-OBAMA - in the Black House
Slammin on people like the rookie Jerry Stackhouse
While Kanye playin with 808s', I'm just keepin you updated
Jus playin James! Y'know we miles ahead
I be tellin these amateurs to put they styles to bed
So go to sleep, ocean deep
Get killed by a Focus... beat
'til they can't walk like they got frozen feet
And you know alot of our shit leak
But it's cool, we got TONS of heat
Uh

[Baatin] (T3)
When you make a track touch the soul, you givin it
Immaculate to the Concept, you live in it
Turn it up top notch, get the feelin
You about to set it off while your head nod
Now you feelin it, now witness the whole scene
We keep it live, turn it up, that's perfection
In the dream and keep it super hot
Bear witness to gift the unwrap and if it don't stop
'til the break of day, we keep it on
Turn it up to the top notch for Dilla to the break of dawn
Keep it LIIIIIIIVE~! {*echoes*}
(Keep-keep-keep it live, keep-keep-keep it live)
Keep-keep-keep it live
Keep it LIIIIIIIIVE~!  {*echoes*}

[T3]
LIVE - Dilla Dawg man I miss you
and I can't express the feelings
Comes to a crack on your track, you know we killed it
Everytime we do a show, you'll always be remembered
When the pen hits the pad, you always in my lyrics
And our friendship is a givena nd your legacy is living
In your path, that you laid, I hope it trickles to your children
This is somethin, gotta mention hope your parents get the right attention
So when the money comes, they the only ones that's benefitin
Yeah, you started this SV shit, so when we spilt
Still wit us, he breed this, Detroit players
Yea, dog, that's that myth, some, tried
But naw dag, it ain't like these, negro please
This is Dillanation, straight 313 with the cups celebratin

    [Intro: sample of Boogie Down Productions' "My Philosophy"]
Rap is like a set-up, a lot of games
A lot of suckas with colorful names
I'm so-and-so, I'm this, I'm that
Huh, but they all just wick-wick-wack

[Joe Budden]
Ladies and gentlemen
With no further adieux {"wick-wick"}
It's your man, Joey! {"wick-wi-wi-wi-wick-wick-wack"}
Look {"wick-wick-wick-wack"}

I'm the perfect one to show ya, all that slick talkin could be over
All it's gon' take's a U-turn from the chauffeur
You test me, you just see
We mix hands with guns, that's the hood's UFC
And me? I never had gear (nah) but since last year
I swore not to cop nothin if it wasn't cashmere
You just salty, I'm fonder than sodium
Anticipate the shots like Obama at the podium
Me and y'all are nowhere near the same pedigree (nah)
Not in layman's terms, hypothetically
Metaphorically, lyrically, not especially
Theoretically (I mean) we just different genetically
And they ain't named me the champion yet
So it's, ACG's, Champion sweats
Homie this is just a thought (for)
The Donny Wall DJ's that don't wanna play the best nigga in New York, dawg

[Chorus]
"Wick-wick-wack"
"Wick, wick-wi-wick-wi-wick-wick-wack"
"Wick-wick-wick-wack"
"Wick-wick-wack"
"Wick, wick-wi-wick-wi-wick-wick-wack"
"Wick-wick-wick-wack"

[Royce Da 5'9"]
OHH! My nigga Spyda is BACK!
5'9", that's me, I'm back baby
Slaughterhouse what?

My nigga Jumpoff said it best - y'all niggaz married to the streets
I'm married to a bottle of PatrÃ³n wearin a weddin dress
Y'all niggaz is dead unless you see we have not been playin
The Slaughterhouse ain't no goddamn gang
Show up to the bar where you hang
Shoot at your bottle like, "Hohh, we pop champagne!"
No disrespect to ol' D's boy Jimmy
I ain't Prince Akeem but I will greet you with the sweepers or the +Semmi+'s
These other lame rappers is broke
They so po' they gotta name 'Loso to have a +Fabolous+ quote
And to the fo'-fo' grabbin they throat tellin 'em choke
Your niggaz arms all froze like they havin a stroke
Admit it y'all, Nickel bonkers, kick and stomp ya
Put a nigga sleepin in a shlomper, I am not the one bruh
This my response to that nigga hidin out in Yonkers
{*crickets chirping*} Haha, that nigga's {*blam*}

[Chorus]

[Joell Ortiz]
Uhh, Joell Ortiz (Joell Ortiz) yup, it's really me
I used to drink the beer promoted by Billy Dee
By the bodega in chancletas and a white tee
Steady cocoa piÃ±a callin papi for a iced tea
Married to the block, that's why I never kept a wifey
Million fish in the sea, I juggled a couple Pisces
Had a fetish for guns, I always kept a few near
Never shot someone but I fired 'em all on New Year's
Never lost a fight, I'm like 25-and-O, what!
Except that time in high school but he jetted when I woke up
E'ry time I spit it's like somebody filled the whole cup
with liquor and just downed it, they hear it wanna throw up
Many nights the fridge held me down with old cold cuts
No mayo? No mustard? No bread? Ah, so what!
On the floor in the corner was my mattress, B
I hated that so I don't rap like you wack MC's

[Chorus]

[Crooked I]
Geah! S-dot H-dot, ha ha!

I laugh after I kill you, I'm a poor sportsman
Slaughterhouse the successors to the Four Horsemen
Niggaz born to pimp so bring some more whores in
Thinkin with my other hand before more foreskin
Me and Red Spyda, roll in a red Spider
Executive Westsider, homie's a tec writer
Homie I check riders, you better stand down
Hands down, you'll be man down on the damn ground
Long Beach, the home of them strap clappers
From ringtoners to backpackers, I smack rappers
Speak on us and we gon' be bendin them street corners
to clap actors, after that brrrap, collapse backwards
Shit, that's when the force roll through
I Malcolm X you pigs, what the pork gon' do?
I Malcolm X the track, that mean arm-leg-leg-arm-head
Body the beat, the torso too, heh
And leave the chorus for you, NIGGA!

    End of Days
   </title>
   <lyrics>
    [Intro: David Icke's "Was He Right?"]
The greatest form of control
is where you think you're free
when you're being fundamentally manipulated and dictated to
One form of dictatorship is being in a prison cell
and you can see the bars and touch them
The other one is sittin in a prison cell
but you can't see the bars and you think you're free
What the human race is suffering from, is mass hypnosis
We are being, hypnotized, by people like this
Newsreaders, politicians, teachers, lecturers
We are in a country and in a world
that is being run by unbelievably sick people
The chasm between what we're told is going on
and what is really going, on is absolutely enormous

[Chorus: Block McCloud]
It's like we all know what's goin down
But no one's sayin shit what happened to the home of the brave?
These motherfuckers they controllin us now
But no one's talkin about it, made us proud to be slaves
And everybody's just walkin around
Head in the clouds, we won't awake until we're dead in the ground
By then it's too late, we need to be ready to raise up
Welcome to the end of days

[Vinnie Paz]
Everybody is slaves, only some are aware
that the government releasin poison in the air
That's the reason I collect so many guns in my lair
I ain't never caught slippin, never under-prepared
Yeah, they Shaitan army, they display it proudly
George Bush the grandson of Aleister Crowley
They want you to believe the lie that the enemy Saudi
The enemy ain't Saudi, the enemy around me
There's fluoride in the water but nobody know that
It's also a prominent ingredient in Prozac (for real?)
How could any government bestow that
A proud people who believe in political throwback
That's not all that I'm here to present you
I know about the black pope in Solomon's temple (yeah)
About the Vatican assassins and how they will get you
And how they cloned Barack Hussein Obama in a test tube

[Chorus]

[Vinnie Paz]
Whoever built the pyramids had knowledge of electrical power
And you know that that's the information that they suppress and devour
Who you think the motherfuckers that crashed in the tower?
Who you think that made it turn into ash in an hour?
The same ones that invaded Jerome
The ones that never told you about the skeletons on the moon (yeah~!)
The ones that poison all the food you consume
The ones that never told you 'bout the Mount Vesuvius tombs (brrap~!)
The Bird Flu is a lie, the Swine Flu is a lie
Why would that even come as a surprise? (yeah)
The Polio vaccine made you die
It caused cancer and it cost a lot of people they lives
Do y'all know about Bohemian Grove?
How the world leaders sacrifice their children in robes?
Lucifer is God in the public school system
I suggest you open up your ears and you listen

[Chorus]

[Outro: David Icke again]
The greatest hypnotist on the planet Earth
is a oblong box in the corner in the room
It is constantly telling us what to believe is real
If you can persuade people, that what they see with their eyes
is what there is to see, you've got them
Because they'll laugh in the face of an explanation
that portrays the bigger picture of what's happening
And they have

    Not My Time
   </title>
   <lyrics>
    (*talking*)
(living my life), let me talk to em
You need to pay attention to the truth, you know it's in
For every death brings new life, and with new life
Our chances are limited, (when it's not my time)
They say it's limited by the experiences, that we may come across
On a day to day basis, it's limited by the circumstances
Of us being less fortunate in life, they say it's limited
By the spirit and the hope that we have, that everybody try to take from ya
But then it's unlimited, when you find peace with God
Come take a walk through the hood with me

[Trae]
Where faith is at a lower level, cause pressure is hard
Thirty years in the cell, will leave a killer acquainted with God
Going to war with pain'll leave you internally scarred
Watching the world crash, is kinda odd
We in the last days, is what they telling me
Eight year old children, being convicted of a felony
Never had a life stereotype, for what they bread to be
Mama did, daddy probably something they will never see
The economy under fire, we owe it to Bush
That's why the hood spend most of they days, blowing president kush
The way he left us feeling, barely gave us a reason to push
Unless he on the verge of suicide, and we give him a push
Katrina came and left our neighbors, with some deadly weather
And off the rip, I beg the Lord to try to make it better
I feel they pain, so now I ride with em like it's whatever
Yeah I represent for New Orleans, and Texas together
I got a kite the other day, from my homies on lock
They begged me not to switch up like the rest, look here homie I'm not
I promise every chance I get to roll, I'm coming to rock
I'm in these penitentiary walls, till they tell me to stop
And it's murder by the many, on another scale
Sirens and a couple shots, that mean another body still
And if we see it, rules got us unable to tell
My heart goes out, to no mo' victims who done been through hell
Just trying less, that by these cowards who ain't men at all
Long as I'm breathing, I ain't gon' let these cowards win at all
And for my people I'ma stand up, till a soldier fall
I'm so serious, ain't no need for me to grin at all
And on another note, my lil' homie mama is a smoker
I promise I wanna help, but she duck off when I approach her
I'm so sensitive to the pain, that I'm numb
Put the world against me, on my babies I ain't fin to run
And speaking of babies, I'm seeing babies having babies
Hoe ass niggaz running through these kids, like they grown ladies
They told me life was gon' get better, when Obama win
And I agree, long as he don't switch up in the end
My brother been in the pen, a little over ten
I gotta send him pictures, just to help him live again
I let him know it's no limit, how far this hand extend
If I gotta die to see him free, then I'll be checking in that's on my spirt homie

[Lynzie Kent]
The voltures, are coming
They're hunting, for your blood
They're circling the streets
But don't give them, what they want
Don't give them what they want, no
And I know, you got a secret
And it's causing you pain
So babe unload, believe it
It won't hurt you again, it won't hurt you again
It won't hurt you again, it won't hurt you again
I look through these eyes, and these eyes only
I live through this life, sometimes it's lonely
I look through these eyes, and these eyes only
I live through this life, sometimes it's lonely
Sometimes it's lonely
Living my life, my life my life

    The Movie
   </title>
   <lyrics>
    [Intro: Jazze Pha]
You are now tuned in {*laughter*}
(It's Gucci) It's a movie baby~!
Yeah baby, pop me some popcorn
We up in here, motion picture shit baby
Watch me!!

[Gucci Mane]
I'm jumpin out my coupe with the missin roof (roof)
And I'm so fuckin high I need a parachute (wow)
"Gucci Mane, do you remember me from last month?"
Girl, I can't remember nothin but my last blunt
Bling blaow diamond necklaces for every chain
Bitch I'm Gucci so I put rims on 'bout everythang
I used to care about money nowadays I don't
So if I like her enough I'll buy her everythang she want
I got that 3-5-7 so don't try your luck
Bullets have yo' body hot you'll need a fire truck
So re-up with us, got white girl yeah that anime
Today I'm shittin on rappers so I called up Jazze Pha
(Oh boy!!)

[Chorus: Gucci Mane] + (Jazze Pha)
I'm not a boy, so I can not be your boyfriend
But if you want me to then I can be yo' Gucci Mane
And if yo' man can't beat it up then I bet Gucci can
Just ask yo' lady and I bet that she's a Gucci fan
(Ladies and gentlemen!) Gucci - buy all my hoes
Gucci - most all my clothes
Gucci - this ain't no Coogi
You still cain't move me
And this is the soundtrack of the Gucci Mane movie
The Gucci Mane movie, the Gucci Mane movie (woo-weee!)

[Gucci Mane]
Lambo' engine in the rear, and I'm switchin gears
Y'all suckers can not fuck with this young nigga here
Diamonds on my neck colder than a case of beer
So when I fall off in the club all the bitches cheer
M6 convertible my top can disappear
Just bought a house in Cali pool parties all through the year
Timbs, fade, stupid waves, I don't wear a beard
They say that Gucci stay fresh but the nigga weird
I shop at Phil Plaza, lil' buddy he shop at Sears
Diamond solitaires so big it damn near broke my ear
Girl you ridin with LaFlare so what you got to fear?
2010 no mo' Rolls Royces, I'm just coppin Lear

[Chorus]

[Gucci Mane]
Jazze Pha, Gucci, know they didn't expect this (Phizzle!)
It ain't no secret, run up on me you'll regret it
I'm like a ball player, focused on my next hit
And I hit homeruns, I don't know how to bunt bitch
And this that Cali kush you need to pass the blunt bitch
I'm sorry that I cussed you baby girl you're gorgeous
Psych you're not gorgeous but your ass is enormous
And if you never call me I'll be rich regardless
Picture perfect flow, this verse here is a portrait
I got three mansions but I'm from Sunvale Apartments
Bouldercrest, Flare shows in Grisham where I started
You wanna fight me bitch just keep ridin down Moreland

[Chorus]

[Outro: Jazze Pha]
Motion picture shit daddy!
It's Gucci Mane, Mane!
Not the motherfuckin local, not the tennis shoe
Mane! The Gucci motherfuckin Mane
Ya underdig? Phizzle Burgundy
Obama Luther King Junior
Jackson Five the First, ya undersmell?
GUCCI BITCHES~!

    Never Let it Go
   </title>
   <lyrics>
    [Chorus - Keys]
If only I could see you again
I will make sure that those days never end
If only I could do it all again
Just to have one more chance
I'll never let it go

[Fabolous talking over Chorus]
I mean life's not like that though
Sometimes you only get one shot
Most times, yeah

[Verse 1 - Fabolous]
Don't you hate a could of, would of, should of nigga?
Could of did, would of did, well you should of nigga (nigga)
I am never on the iffy shit
You see her with me, you ain't gotta wonder if he hit
My daddy was a player too, Ken Griffey shit
He said kill these hoes and get the death certificates (haha)
So when I do me, I over do it
In the red Rover sendin bitches over to it
Might use the Caddy, part-time golfer
But act now I'm a limited time offer
And I'm off the, chain like a stray dog
If I want it, I'm a fetch it, I don't play dog (I don't play dog)
I see the game from a sick angle
New York had a chance, the bitch pick Tango
In my case you get one opportunity
Minus convertible, so let's call it drop-tunity, haha

[Chorus]

[Verse 2 - Fabolous]
Get a slice of the pie now, you wait 'til the pizza's cold
Then you sayin what you +Shoulda+ did like Keyshia Cole
+I Should Have Cheated+ (nah), I +Shoulda Let You Go+ (nah)
I just shake 'em off (yeah), Etch A Sketch a ho (haha)
I draw a blank, back to the drawing board
I'm like Michael Jordan if we talkin scorin broads (damn)
To me you got one chance to miss ya shot (yeah)
Better get ya J up (yeah), life is not a layup (nah)
Meanin, sometime they make it hard
Like a straight dude, naked broad get on top of me
Why give an inch if she can take a yard? (woo)
You land on "Chance," take a card, it's Monopoly
I think past "Go" (yeah), 200 on my mental dash though
And my foot is on the gas ho
If opportunity ain't there, make one
They ain't give me a chance, so I had to take one, Los'

[Chorus]

[Fabolous talking over Chorus]
Niggaz be lookin at shit that's right in front of 'em man
They don't even see their chance is right in front of 'em
You know? It's fucked up

[Verse 3 - Fabolous]
I look at Obama and I more than glance
I don't just see change, I saw a chance
How many hustlers do you know waitin for a chance?
Some pedal more than Lance in the Tour de France
How many convicts inside waitin for a break?
That's rare, short time, waitin for a steak
How many shooters holdin heat, waitin for a shot?
Fall asleep in the car waitin for a shot
Sniper's in D.C., I know what he see
I'm tryin to put you on to it, Cici
Just ate fried chicken, I took greasy
I told this bitch I'm a Mac/Mack not a P.C. (haha)
I sit niggaz down, don't let 'em stand a chance
Only way you squares ride is a ambulance
Kill 'em while you got a chance in a Bronco
Or it comes back in the end, Benny Blanco, yes

    The Gospel of Hip-Hop
   </title>
   <lyrics>
    [KRS-One]
It's always a privilege to spit with Lars
I'm a reality speaker, forget them cars
I'm learnin how to teleport to reach to Mars
When you love this and live this you spit your bars
I spit a quick barrage, switch the odds
before you get burnt by all these lit cigars
I spit because the time is upon us
Prophecy, education, Nostradamus
Are they the future or really far behind us?
Past perceptions tryin to find us and blind us
It's funny especially when Nostradamus
that none of these prophecies saw the Obamas
Life is a stage and it goes through dramas
So rewrite your script and replace your commas
Life is the crown-work, you're the farmer
The seed is the idea - Kris Parker!

[Chorus]
Everything's fall-every-everything's falling a
Everything's fall-every-everything's falling apart!
You can't control me, you can't control me
Everything's falling apart
You can't control me, you can't control me

[MC Lars]
{Every-every-everything}
Born in eighty-two, I voted for Obama
It took ten years but they finally got Osama
Pax Americana goin Seal Team Six (uh-huh)
Time to H.E.A.L. these kids, Kris I know they feel these riffs!
Hip-Hop is the culture, I watch it grow and breathe
The iGeneration knows exactly what it needs
We're keeping our humanity, empowerment through art
Society is changing, evolution starts (you see)
Hip-Hop taught me how to be a man
How to find my voice and love everything I am
Inspired by the youth, their knowledge and their passion
The way they shine the light, like Plato did in Athens
(Teach~!) What this means is that Knowledge Reigns Supreme
Over Nearly Everybody, never give up on your dreams
Clean energy, equality, and a cure for AIDS
It's on us cause we've got it and that's why we keep the faith

[Chorus]

[KRS-One]
{Everything's falling a} The weather's goin crazy
The Earth's magnetic field is gettin wavy, people are feelin more lazy
The future is hazy
In prayer we ask "Is this the end?" and God replies "Maybe!"
The whole system is shaky and unreliable
National debt is astronomical
Poor people find this desirable
Screamin "I've got money" when poverty is undeniable
The corrupt is diabolical, at times even comical
I'm not typical, I'm topical
Poetically philosophical
Today's education is unapplyable
I think with my abdominal, life is phenomenal
You make it all up wit'cha optical
Every moment is optional
That means anything I think in a blink is possible

[Chorus]

[MC Lars]
{Everything's falling a} Yo
I'm in a van with my band rockin clubs
Rockin pubs worldwide and I do it for the love cause
I see the light in the eyes of the audience
The elements are heavensent it's awesome and it's obvious
You see - we've been graph writing since the hieroglyphics
Breakin since the dawn of time cause we're so prolific
It's that universal rhythm, griots on a mission
Goin back to Africa with stories they were spittin
Ableton, Serrato, look how far we've come
Before we had computers deejays beat on logs and drums
Humming melodies and lyrics I can hear it in my spirit (true)
Peace to Scott LaRock, cause he helped to engineer it (LEGEND)
Want to spread the message of salvation over 808's
Digital humanities, we candidly deflect the hate
Let's work to heal the planet, hip-hop is the gospel
With KRS the teacher, and MC Lars apostle!!

    There Will Be Blood (Remix)
   </title>
   <lyrics>
    [Intro 4X: Biz Markie samples]
{"Rock the house and, on and on and"}
{"Rock the house and"}

[Celph Titled]
If me and some rap faggot have static
We can go to war, at your show you'll need flak jackets
Strapped with automatics? No we use bats and hatchets
Give the microphone a drug test, I spit crack at it, for crack addicts
Approach your A&amp;R with an AR
Based on a true story, I spit H-bombs in every eight bars
When Tony put his face in that snow, I was writin them flavor flows
And yeah even my worst haters know that I'm a player for sho'
They be like "Yeah I'm wit'cha Titled"
Bring bitches back to the pad, like a menstrual cycle
You walk around like you some kinda thuggy guy
I know you ain't Diddy but I can make you see through Puffy eyes

[Sadat X]
You know my stats, boy, you know what I'm workin with~!
Firearms of various calibers penetrate
I'm the hate that breeds hate - nah, let me illustrate
Time stands still on a day that's slow
With me it ain't about the show, it's 'bout the proof
I aim from the roof, make any fatal move and this is a stick-up
You sneeze or even hiccup lou layin flat
You wanna face this rage? Somebody throw some meat in the cage
Wear armor, you can call Obama, call your momma!
I breed armies, make men out of boys
I'm your tactical General Patton, from BK to Manhattan
You frontin, you lame, treat your whole squad the same

[Grand Puba]
I don't play when it come to this, I rule the mic with the iron fist
Compile data, then I make the list
Grab the whack move their ass to trash
then empty trash so they don't exist
Since vinyl, words flow like herds of rhinos
Leave your ass trampled when I'm runnin on a sample
A showdown at sundown, these verbals I run down
will leave yo' ass dumbfound, you thought you was gunned down
Rhyme style mean like a dopefiend lean
Head against the green and you face the guillotine
Grand Puba, there's no way you can dodge
Better off tryin your luck in Las Vegas at Mirage

[A.G.]
Been through ups and downs, never touched the ground
Like girls with the big butts, never fuck with clowns
I let the music take over me, words flow through me
Truly the best, that's why niggaz keep quotin me
I'm the baddest nigga livin, average niggaz don't stand a chance
I danced in France, put hands and feets on beats
Put fans in trances, Amsterdam is
a place where I sin, get that yen in Japan kid
The Swiss mountains, I got a Swiss accountant
Chick with a fountain pen keep my chips amountin
to somethin, my ground is unparalled
While y'all niggaz keep on horsin around like carousels

[O.C.]
Yeah mind over; as a matter of fact
there's no practice needed, see, I'm matched by none
When it's all said and done up, the last man standin is proof
Who has the biggest brass in battles a crafty MacGyver
E'ryday things round me work to my advantage
Cream get the plan at random
So every livin soul on the planet understand this
As some often say, an heir is apparent
I'm that Maltese priceless art
There's no biddin on an auction block, fortune of Fort Knox
Off top or written, each vowel takes precicsion
Knockout solidifies when they fight over decision

[Diamond D]
I got the flow so cold niggaz call me Chilly
Don't ever press up, fam I'll smack you silly
If I'm all out of dutches, I pack the Phillie
On my, J-O-B, I mack the millies
And I'm all about stackin my chips
Gettin dome in the back of the whips, start smackin them hips
All that slick talk'll just get you smacked in the lips
Game time, fourth quarter, back to the blitz
You can't move me, shake me, break me, make me
be somethin I'm not, niggaz wanna snake me
I'm right by Skate Key, right in the 'X
Big Diam' still writin the checks, holla at me

   <lyrics>
    {"On to the next one, on to the next one" - *repeat in background*}

[Intro: Swizz Beatz] + (Jay-Z)
I got a million ways to get it (uh-huh, geah)
... Choose one (choose one, hey)
Ay, bring it back, bring it back (uh-huh)
Now double your money and make a stack
I'm on to the next one, on to the next one
I'm on to the next one, on to the next one
I'm on to the next one, on to the next one
I'm on to the next one, on to the next one
(Hold up) Freeze! Ay!
Somebody bring me back the money please, hey

[Jay-Z]
Hov' on that new shit, niggaz like "How come?"
Niggaz want my old shit, buy my old album
Niggaz stuck on stupid, I gotta keep it movin
Niggaz make the same shit, me I make +The Blueprint+
Came in the Range, hopped out that Lexus
Every year since, I been on that next shit
Traded in the gold for the platinum Rolexes
Now a nigga wrist match the status of my records
Used to rock a throwback, ballin on the corner
Now I rock a teller suit, lookin like a owner
No I'm not a Jonas, Brother I'm a grown-up
No I'm not a virgin, I use my cojones
I move onward, the only direction
Can't be scared to fail, searchin perfection
Gotta keep it fresh girl, even when we sexin
But don't be mad at him when he's on to the next one

[Chorus: Swizz Beatz]
Freeze! Ay!
Somebody bring me back the money please, hey
I got a million ways to get it
... Choose one
Ay, bring it back, bring it back
Now double your money and make a stack
I'm on to the next one, on to the next one
I'm on to the next one, on to the next one
I'm on to the next one, on to the next one
I'm on to the next one, on to the next one
(Hold up) Freeze! Ay!
Somebody bring me back the money please, hey

Fuck a throwback jersey cause we on to the next one
And fuck that Auto-Tune cause we *onnnnn*
And niggaz don't be mad cause it's all about progression
Loiterers should be arrested
I used to drink Cristal, the muh'fucker's racist
So I switched gold bottles on to that Spade shit
You gon' have another drink or you just gon' baby-sit
On to the next one, somebody call the waitress
Baby I'm a boss, I don't know what they do
I don't get dropped, I drop the label
World can't hold me, too much ambition
Always knew it'd be like this when I was in the kitchen
Niggaz in the same spot, me I'm dodgin raindrops
Meanin I'm on vaca', chillin on a big yacht
Yeah I got on flip-flops, white Louie boat shoes
Y'all should grow the fuck up, c'mere let me coach you
Hold up

[Chorus]

[Jay-Z]
Uhh, +Big Pimpin'+ in the house now
Bought the land, tore the muh'fuckin house down
Bought the car, tore the muh'fuckin roof off
Ride clean, I don't ever take the shoes off
Bought the jeep, tore the muh'fuckin doors off
Foot out that bitch, ride the shit like a skateboard
Navigation on, tryin to find my next thrill
Feelin myself, I don't even need an X pill
Can't chill but my neck will
Haters really gon' be mad off my next deal
Uhh, I don't know why they worry 'bout my pockets
Meanwhile I had Oprah chillin in the projects
Had her out in Bed-Stuy, chillin on the steps
Drinkin quarter waters, I gotta be the best
M.J. at Summer Jam, Obama on the text
Y'all should be afraid of what I'm gon' do next
Hold up

[Chorus]

    Stand Up (Tribute to Sean Bell)
   </title>
   <lyrics>
    Grind House
Sean Bell, everybody

[Chorus: Swizz Beatz]
Get up, stand up, get up
Get up, stand up, get up
Get up, stand up, we gotta fight for our rights, huh
Get up, stand up, get up
Get up, stand up, get up
Get up, stand up, we gotta fight for our rights, huh

It's crazy, man it's crazy
Man it's crazy, man it's crazy
Get up, stand up, get up
Get up, stand up, get up
Get up man, we gotta stand fight for our rights, huh

[Cassidy]
The boy Sean in heaven cause he was born in hell
To feed his daughter, he husteled like I ain't gon fail
He was an electrician but wasn't doing well
I ain't gon say he sold drugs but kept going to jail
He wasn't doing right cause life wasn't going well
I'm gon tell a story, ghostwritten by Sean Bell
Detective suppose to protect us, but now dectective shoot us
They ruthless like Michael Oliver and Detective Cooper
Obama, when you get elected, please improve the law
Cause they ain't have to shoot 50 shots and a moving car
Them cops admit that they did it and still got aquitted
But if we fight our rights, one day we got to get it

[Chorus]

[Drag-On]
Yeah, chea, uh, uh
Niggas in New York like on the cell
Turn to kid got shot named Sean Bell
Damn, another good soldier fell
If he would've did it, he would've got no bail
What's going on? I can't tell, cops getting away with that murder murder
50 shots right through the car, and they ain't even find out one burner
Cause all they wanna do is meet the quoter
Running up, killing niggas on the corner
Better watch out for they for they pop up on ya
Cause cops every block hot as a sauna
Another young black casualty
That's the government strategy
In the hood, they harassing me
What happened to Sean can't happen to me
I feel for his moms (yeah), I feel for his pops (yeah)
When I heard that verdict, I peeled through the block
Feel his family pain, what a way to die
Just try to keep your sane, it's ok to cry

[Chorus]

[Maino]
Listen, look, now I can't help but think what if that man was me
What if the rose was different, I was him and he was me
What if he had the chance to live out his wildest dreams
What if his 50 shots came directly after me?
What if my son was crying? Police, they keep on lying
What if my girl was live hurting? Al Sharpton says defying
This shit is crazy, they got our babies
Feels like the world is a prison, we in the case and
There ain't no hope for us, look at how they hurting us
Dirty cops and politicians, I don't have a soul to trust
Hope is not enough, we need to open up
We need to fight, we need to change, we need to do for us

[Chorus]

[Styles P.]
People come to march, but I come to spark blue
Throw it in your head, they on kill us cause we dark
Now once the police, (what up), a black man is running for president
But still no justice, no peace
Just we in our own hell up in New York City
And I'm thinking what a pity, every man is Sean Bell
Is a black man a bullseye? Just a moving target to 'em
Let it go, reload, we that much of a problem to 'em?
Judge let the cop go, we that much of a problem to 'em?
How your honor ain't got no honor to 'em?
Peace to the family of Bells
I respect how you're strong, may your family be well

[Chorus]

[Talib Kweli]
Yo, yeah, yeah, get up, stand up
Man, get up, stand up, yeah, no, no
No he didn't come to mourn, not another mother torn
Not another brother gone, something's wrong, the last thing we need is another song
Man, the proof of lack of leadership like a truth up in the media
My people in need of a solution, we need some civil disobedience
They stuck glued to they TV screen and they believe what's on they computer screen
The cops did they job and did it well, that's how the judge views the scene
Skip the jury of their peers
Now the Bell family's eyes is blurry with their tears, you feel the fury everywhere
Nothing left than assassintation, exaggeration of the facts
Fabrications is facinating, the beast is waiting to attack
Gotta face it, if you're black and you're young
It's predetermine that you that you pack a gun, people shouting black to everyone

Bad like she bad with money like Oprah
She wine to the reggae, bubble to soca
Cool like Taraji sweet like Nicole
Scherzinger like Sharwhen she comin from the cold
Tall like Keri and sing like Estelle
Legs like Amerie and she don't tell
When she kiss, a down ass chick like Lil' Kim
She ready for the camera Kim Kardashian
Curves like Melissa, tough like Michelle (OBAMA!!!!)
All day the queen like Mary J.
Good like Keyshia, young like Ri Ri
Sayin ain't that Kardinal on the TV, you see me!!!
Remix, Kardinal, Akon, Sean Paul
Take our ting right straight to di wall

[Chorus: Akon]
That girl is so dangerous, that girl is so DANGEROUS

[Verse 2: Akon]
See your the type of girl that make me wait
I'm the type of guy that make you relocate
Participatin in no chase
Got all type of girls I'm 'gon be straight
Honeys like you come a dime a dozen
Real financially should be my cousin
Hips sprung think I am when I wasn't
And you wanna cling cling on me then be your husband
A baby daddy, a sugar daddy
I don't give a damn either way I'm a have it
The way I be shootin that gun automatic
Got chicks from every part of the world goin at it
Like they don't ask it, but it's so classic
How the club be gettin broken down in masses
By the same chicks with these big ol' asses
Just droppin and shakin it fast
It's so dangerous, it's so dangerous, she's so dangerous

[Chorus: Akon] (Sean Paul)
Watch out I've seen her type before

[Verse 4: Twista]
How she, full with adrenaline feelin all sowed up
Fillin 'em filled with venom kill 'em like a cobra
Thinkin I'm in danger when I tell her come over
Like a scary endeavor whenever I hold her
Speakin in tongues just speedin my lyrical pace
Look at the fanny now look at the body now take a look at the face
Dangerous as Angelina Jolieand more than a man eater
Manipulatin any man if she want him
Cause a, we be spectacular mackin in back in the truck in the Acura
But she need to act up and let out the boys in us
Havin a premonition then I'm reminiscin
About a girl with New Edition already says she's poisonous
Like Paris Hilton, Nicole or Lindsay Lo
Madonna, Naomi or Giselle the blanco, OHHHH!!!!
My life will never let a bomb chick abuse it
It's Kardinal, Twista, Konvict music

[Outro: Kardinal Offishall]
Just gotta remember she's dangerous, she's dangerous, she's dangerous
Cause she's a bad, bad girl!!!!
She's dangerous, she's dangerous, she's dangerous
Cause she's a bad, bad girl!!!!

    [Intro] [Kardinal Offishall talking]
Bishop, what up my nigga? T Dot is in the area
Yeah, Black Jays and Konvict is in the area
(What up Black Milk?) Yeah, Kardinal

[Verse One]
It's so refreshin' when you hear my voice enter the mic device
My existence to rap is like Sunday to Christ
I'm an affluent member of the cream of the crop
AKA stop rappin', let the bullshit stop
I ignite much burnin' in the hearts of men
Reinstate the faith, hardcore will come again
It's acrobatical, the way I flip my thoughts
Like Ricky Ross flip coke in the 80's boss
I'm all action
Whether on stage or not
The national anthem for T Dot is "Bumbaclot"
So say it loud, stand up with your fists in the air
If the shoe don't fit, nigga buy a new pair
I was told niggas hate when they don't have shit
They unhappy with the type of success they get
It's a whole new era like my man J-Dee
After bullshittin', hatin', niggas get that money
I defend where I'm from like a Muslim militant
Rob from bitch niggas and I give to the innocent
Like a modern crusader who feels for the youth
I stay classy but sometimes I act uncouth
Like Ol' Dirty with a 40 yellin', "Brooklyn Zoo"
Rest in peace, when I'm actin' a beast, that's for you
Jeah
With no fear, I embrace my home
And make paper like I share stock tips with Sean Combs
I ain't never sold a key, wasn't really my thing
I sell dreams like I'm kinfolk to M.L. King
With the attitude of Malcolm
Height to string a bell
Connects like Iphone, nigga all is well
I'm so icey
My nature has gone stone cold
I'm old school
I still live by a real code
Stay loyal to your niggas, never snitch, MAN UP
If you get it like I get, nigga put your hands up
Black Jays!

[Chorus] [x2]
Everything I utter
I keep it raw for you
Everyday I made it hot
Year round
Real hip hop back on top
Fuck for formula
Back how we used to rock
Fuck bar structure

[Verse Two] [Bishop Lamont]
Kick a billion bars
Big words, science text books, spit stars
Influenced by Redman, Keith Murray, Nas
Canibus
Long before +Chicken Noodle Soup+ and fancy cars
Name brands, Biggie made it fresh but y'all niggas made a mess
Helped to slip and fall of rap to it's death
Depth
Or lack of
Took it from the basement out the streets to the nightclub
And left it
Ain't nothin' wrong with dancin'
But every fuckin' song you niggas romancin'
Get the current top singer, there's the hook
Get Timbaland or Scott at a video and cook
Ten minutes later, ding, out the oven
Come another dance song, beats soundin' southern
But you ain't southern, nigga you buggin'
Cause back in '96, 2Pac had you thuggin'
It seem to me the industry got an identity crisis
Imitate whatever hot, not what's the nicest
But what entices the purchase, the prices
Sell your soul, let it float till you're lifeless
So rest in piss you won't be missed
Can't reach or teach slow niggas
So it's classed dismissed
And in the end it's just a pad and a pen
Tryin' to time travel, bring the old days back again

[Chorus] [x2]
Everything I utter
I keep it raw for you
Everyday I made it hot
Year round
Real hip hop back on top
Fuck for formula
Back how we used to rock
Fuck bar structure

[Verse Three] [Trek Life]
6-0-6
Makin' a trip out to Grey One, just to cop me some new kicks
Fresh to the finish, vintage lodge city attitude
Bad mouth the old school friends sayin', "He mad at you."
Thanks little dude you keep my laughin'
As I gain latitude
Realize you never really mattered at all
Little chatterin' broad
I'm money magnetic
Feel blessed to be in the man's presence
I'm on the grind like I'm runnin' for election
Thee Obama of this rap shit, here to capture the essence of the eargasm
Wordsmith, you Will Smith actor
A non factor in the grand scheme
Pass you like a Grand Prix at mach speed
You like, "It can't be"
Yes it can, I do it all to get you mad
All the shows, all the tours, all the freshest raps
Overseas, makin' cheese, niggas shut your trap
Where I'm at homie touch the map
I spin the globe
Then conquer wherever it stop at
And I can kill at heavy metal to a pop track
Ensure my longevity and move steadily
So I'ma let it live and let it be man
And watch my daughter put her first hand prints in the sand
Freestyle off the top of the dome
It's like...
Naaah. I'm just kiddin' man. Let's keep it rollin'. Peace

   </title>
   <lyrics>
    [Intro: Termanology] (DJ Premier scratching)
Uh! Premo, Pre-mo, Bun B, Bun-B (Now-Now-Now this is how we rock!)
This is how we (ROCK) This is how we (ROCK)
This is how we (R-R-R-ROCK-ROCK)
This is how we (You ready?) Let's go, yeah!
(Now-Now-Now-Now-Now-Now-Now-Now-Now this is how we rock!)

[Verse 1: Termanology]
Yo! Hopped off this phone with Bun, rolled this blunt
Told him son your album so cold I'm numb
Fittin to go plat, but If I go gold just once
I copped enough coke and guns to open Trump
Towers of my own, then I control the slums
Where the birds and the rats and the roaches from
Far as rap goes, I'm the coldest one
Just gimme the mic, I'll show you the soul of Pun
Like, I'll grip the mini matic irratically fat as family
Snatchin vanity Violator couldn't manage me
Uh! They don't really want it what Tony Montana be sniffin
Danity Kane so insane is reality
My pain is reality, grippin this mic
After me other rappers don't sound that TIIIIGHHHHHHHHHTTTTTT!!!!
Ology in the place with Bun B
And we got what it takes to rock the mic RIIIGHHHHHHHHTTTTTTTTTT!!!!!

Chorus: Termanology] (DJ Premier scratching)
This is how we (ROCK) This is how we (ROCK)
This is how we (R-R-R-R-ROCK-ROCK)
This is how we (ROCK-R-R-R-R-ROCK)
This is how we (ROCK-ROCK-R-ROCK

[Bun B] (DJ Premier scratching)
This is how we (ROCK) This is how we (ROCK)
This is how we (R-R-R-R-R-R-R-ROCK)
This is how we (ROCK-R-R-ROCK-R)
This is how we (ROCK-R-ROCK-Now this is how we rock!)

[Verse 2: Bun B]
I be jumpin out the bushes like a jag, boy
Better watch yo' back boy, the king of the trill is in the buildin
Killin the track boy, act boy, like you want do it
Get smacked, boy, head cracked boy, I thought you knew it
Matter fact, boy, you in the wrong place with the wrong one
On the shark pier and you 'bout to walk the long one
Sing a sad song son, play a violin
To your preacher to the choir, G I'm about to end you
Bun B, the best that did it and still doin it
Cut on the track and I'm black and blue in it, ruin it
Like a, wet dream better keep it movin like a jet stream
With me and Termanology out to get cream
We on the next scheme while you still plannin the first
Dyin of thirst, I po' out a bottle for Pimp C!
UGK fo' life, nothing above it
With Premier on the beat and Termanology you gotta love it!

[Chorus: Bun B] [*Termanology] (DJ Premier scratching)
This is how we (ROCK) *This is how we (ROCK)
This is how we (R-R-R-R-ROCK)
*This is how we (ROCK-R-R-R-ROCK-)
This is how we (R-R-R-R-R-R-ROCK-ROCK)
*This is how we (ROCK) This is how we (ROCK)
This is how we (R-OCK-R-OCK-ROCK)
This is how we (ROCK-ROCK-ROCK-ROCK)
This is how we (ROCK-R-R-R-R-R-ROCK!)

[Verse 3: Termanology]
Put the mind and the body with the rhyme and the shotty
Gonna find me a mami sippin lime and Bacardi
Get down like John Gotti with the mafia behind me
Gettin profit like the sign me army closin when ya find me then
Uh, I keep bombin that Osama ship predominately coffins
At the novelist involed in this more tonic shit
You gotta follow it the cat you pop a bottle with
Still, go on and rock this shit Bun what's the politics?

[Verse 4: Bun B]
Term, you already know it's Obama '08
Cats in the streets is like, mo' skama, mo' weight
The rap industry is mo' drama, mo' hate
Mo' Money means you got Mo' Problems on yo' plate
It's all good though cause we still in the hood though
Gettin love where these fake rappers wish they could go
I wish they would show they face in the ghetto
We put 'em in a nice, deep, dark place in the ghetto, for real!

[Chorus: Termanology] [*Bun B] (DJ Premier scratching)
This is how we (ROCK) This is how we (ROCK)
*This is how we (R-R-ROCK-R-R-R-ROCK)
*This is how we (R-R-R-R--R-ROCK)
This is how we (ROCK-ROCK)
This is how we (ROCK) *This is how we (ROCK)
This is how we (ROCK)
This is how we (R-R-ROCK)
This is how we (ROCK-Now this is how we rock!)

    Unauthorized Biography of Muhammad Ali
   </title>
   <lyrics>
    [Shawn Boothe]
The unauthorized copy...
Dedicated to The Greatest
{I am the king of the world!}
{Never talk about who's gonna stop me
'Cause NOBODY gonna stop me!}
{I must be the greatest!}
My name Shaun Boothe
{I'm a BAD man! I SHOOK UP THE WORLD!}

[Chapter 3]
Born Cassius, Clay Jr.
January 17th in '42
Louisville, Kentucky he grew up
A little boy doing what a little boy do
'Til somebody stole his bike
Swearing up and down they would pay the price
A police officer overheard
Laughed at the child and gave advice
Told him to take that rage to fight
"Come to my gym and train to fight"
Little did he know that would change his life
Make him a star, put his name in lights
As an amateur, he would bandage up, anyone he faced
Due to his, tutelage, even then, you knew the kid
was destined to be great
Golden child - 8 Golden Gloves
on the road to Olympic gold, in Rome
Everything he dreamed
Got his ticket then his feet got cold
Praying in the aisles on the way to the fight, he made it!
And in that 1960 Olympics' victory
He declared himself The Greatest
Critics watched and frowned, at his boxing style
Said he couldn't keep his guard up
He wasn't pro and they still couldn't knock him down, uh!
Hands low, damn he can dance though!
Made em look too stiff to box
A punch too quick to clock
You get hit before you get from tick to tock
Uh, and by '64 he was giving knockout predictions
What round they would hit the floor, ridiculing his opposition
Dismissed as the Louisville Lip, outspoken but never out-boxed
Liston finally gave in, and Clay got his first title shot
He even put out an album
Threw a few Sonny poems together
And called it "I Am the Greatest"
Some say the first battle raps ever
He said he'd knock him out in eight
But nobody believed, nobody listened
...'Til the headlines came, "Cassius Clay beats Sonny Liston"
And after that, huge upset he upset the world
When he announced he was a member of the Nation of Islam
He lashed back like, "What was it I did wrong, huh?"
And in the fashion of Malcolm X, for whom he had profound respect
From his slave name he said, "I'm free"
And he became young Muhammad Ali
Then the love for him got outweighed by outrage
And fear of his new devout faith
To an organization perceived as only being about hate
Years later, he refused the draft, denounced the war
On the grounds of religious beliefs, then they hated him more
They told him go to jail or go to Vietnam
Then they took his title, and his boxing license
So he took it to court and fought three years long
Now somewhere in that time America realized the war was wrong
And he went from, traitor to hero
And in a year or so he was coming back strong
Uh, moving with such grace and ease
Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee
Hand can't hit what your eyes cant see
Then came the fight of the century {*two bell dings*}
Ali, Joe Frasier
As far as match-ups there were no greater
First professional loss, but he would beat him in a rematch later
But by then Frasier lost the belt
To a man by the name of George Foreman
Much stronger and younger than Ali
Still he said, "I'm in. if you're in"
Then came the "Rumble. in the Jungle", promoted by Don King
In '74 they went to Zaire
He got out the plane like What do I hear?
They were saying {ALI, BOMA YE! ALI, BOMA YE! ALI, BOMA YE!}
It was much more than some ego stroke
He knew he gave the poor people hope
Against the odds, toe to toe
Swarming crowds, overflow
But no matter how hard he fought
They said Foreman would never be stopped
But instead of going blow for blow
He let him go for broke, punched himself out
Later they would call it the Rope-a-dope
And in the eighth round everything turned around!
Ali springs from the ropes, swinging fearlessly and Foreman goes down
And the whole crowd erupts in amazement when he can't beat the count
And a new King is crowned, fighting for the poor and oppressed
His victory, made history
But it was more than just being the best
It was character, it was charisma
Being someone that cares for us
You see, he redefined the word CHAMPION
To a category that the rest cant be in

[Outro]
The unauthorized biography of Muhammad Ali
Epilogue:
The next seven years of his legendary boxing career were not without its price
And in the early 80s' he would go on to develop Parkinsons disease
Presumably due to all of the punishment he had endured
But that didn't stop Ali from what he called his true life calling
In humanitarian endeavours
Travelling around the world as the goodwill ambassador, to us all
The End.

Next chapter: Martin Luther King, Jr. and Barack Obama

    [Intro: Lloyd Banks]
Yeah! Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah!!!
Uh! 'Yeah my music 'bout the money
Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah!

[Verse One: Lloyd Banks]
Uh! I meet my Forbes at the corner store
The way you niggas rappin out here, I just want it more
Turn the music down you can hear my stomach roar
Bagged a hundred bitches last year just bagged a hundred more
They hatin, But everything that goes comes back
Sticky green funpack jewelry make me hump back
Backpackers want that, and it ain't about the diamonds
Shit! Home or commercial who the fuck you think you rhymin with?!
I got the drama kit, on my Obama whip
Bitches runnin up on my stage, Lil' Mama shit
And  lil' mama thick, and my time was slim
Gone by thirty minutes after I put the condom in

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
I'm gettin to dough, Louis on my foot put the pedal to the flo'
That's all a nigga know!!!

[Lloyd Banks]
Payback!!! Don't come around here disrespectin
We don't take that!!! I'm on my letters every second

[50 Cent]
And my heart so cold, man I don't trust a soul
Surely know the bullshit goes you never know

[Lloyd Banks]
Payback!!! Don't come around here disrespectin
We don't take that!!! I'm on my letters every second

[Verse Two: Lloyd Banks]
They crown me with the punch hat who better?!
I hit Redskins, smoke green and spit blue pepper
(UH!) Benz blue leather (UH!) Jet cool weather
(UH!) Cool meanin hot, so I don't need the top
Calm down breathin stop I start I'm a skip your pulse
Mr. life's the shit Calamari shrimp and boats
C-notes, fly Ferrari different coast
Masseuse and butler I probably ain't gotta lift my toes
I shut my doors on 'em like Jehovah's witness
I done made it to the top like I said, I told you bitches
They don't really want me they just want my riches
So I'm a fuck 'em all, friends, cousins and sisters

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
I'm gettin to dough, Louis on my foot put the pedal to the flo'
That's all a nigga know!!!

[Lloyd Banks]
Payback!!! Don't come around here disrespectin
We don't take that!!! I'm on my letters every second

[50 Cent]
And my heart so cold, man I don't trust a soul
Surely know the bullshit goes you never know

[Lloyd Banks]
Payback!!! Don't come around here disrespectin
We don't take that!!! I'm on my letters every second

[Verse Three: Lloyd Banks]
I turn the club to TV and come Dancing With The Stars
Then I'm in your ear, in her ear, ampin the menage (Yeah)
Niggas they made their money but never knew how it felt
(UH!) In a hundred pairs of pants thats a hundred pairs of belts
Stress kills chronic helps, pussy is for the moment
Ballin like a hornet, see it get it I want it
Everybody know heat hurts you gotta show me first
Magician, but I can turn 'em to a Holy Ghost
You can bring two, three, four of them the war is won
Tip top 'gon make 'em all run, come on son
Think talk just talk, I let my money bark
Put my Ferrari in park, give 'em a runnin start
GO!!! 'Cause I don't feel a single drop of pressure
NO!!! Eagles drop a foreign gwop collector
He better stop pull ahead, he knows my ends straight
I'll clap your girl make the bed break leak the sex tape

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
I'm gettin to dough, Louis on my foot put the pedal to the flo'
That's all a nigga know!!!

[Lloyd Banks]
Payback!!! Don't come around here disrespectin
We don't take that!!! I'm on my letters every second

[50 Cent]
And my heart so cold, man I don't trust a soul
Surely know the bullshit goes you never know

[Lloyd Banks]
Payback!!! Don't come around here disrespectin
We don't take that!!! I'm on my letters every second

[50 Cent]
I'm gettin to dough, Louis on my foot put the pedal to the flo'
That's all a nigga know!!!

[Lloyd Banks]
Payback!!! Don't come around here disrespectin
We don't take that!!! I'm on my letters every second

    Seduction
   </title>
   <lyrics>
    [Samples behind Eminem]
Like a verbal seduction when
Seduction when I tell her...Girls on the shore
Girl, Girl, Girl...Right Now...Girls on the shore
Girl, Girl, Girl...Like a verbal seduction when...Girls on the shore
Girls on the shore...

[Eminem]
I don't know man, it just feels like...we're a lot different
I kinda feels like...I'm on a whole different page right now, than you
It feels strange but um...but I guess it's kinda like...it's kinda like

[Eminem]
I feel like I'm morphin'
Into something that's so incredible that I'm dwarfin'
All competitors
Better get your girlfriend in check
It's psychological warfare
Endorphines I affect
Your self-esteem shatters his dialect
Comes blastin out ya deck, she loves me
Such passion you'd expect
This sort of reaction, from her yet
You're stronger, you're fuck'n corny
You try to turn...your charm on
Cuz you just think you're 'bishop the Don Juan
But if you think you're fucking with me, homie you're on one
I'm cock'n my head back like Ed Lover, come on son
She's on my Johnson, she brings my name up constant
You're boys are like, "She's fuck'n with dude, she wants 'em"
Oh boy, you better get a clue
She's on my dick cuz I spit better than you
What you expect her to do?
How you expect her to act in the sack?
When she's close'n her eyes
Fantasizing her diggn' her nails in my back to this track

[Chorus]
[Eminem] + (Samples)
Seduction, Seduce
Ain't nobody who's as good at what I do          (It's like a verbal seduction when...)
Cuz one minute she loves you, the next she don't
She's been stolen from you                       (It's like a verbal seduction when...)
Seduction, Seduce                                (Seduction when I got girls on the shore...)
Ain't nobody who's as good at what I do
Cuz one minute she loves you, the next she don't (I got girls on the shore...)
She's been stolen from you                       (It's like a verbal seduction when...)

[Eminem]
She's sitting there gettin' liquored up at the bar
She says it's quicker to count the things that ain't wrong with you
Than to count the things that are
There's a 7 disc CD changer in the car
And I'm in every single slot, and you're not (Aw!)
I'm the logo on that Dallas Cowboy helmet (a star!)
And I'm not about to sit back and just keep rhym'n one syllable (Naw!)
Switch it up, and watch them haters not give it up
Cuz they just not good enough, but I'm not givin up
Til I get my respect, and I won't stop til I get enough
Cuz I'm not livin up to my own expectations (Aw!)
That hater alarm is sound'n, ah, but Obama took the bomb from my name (Oa!)
So quit crying that I took your dame homie, she my dame (aw!)
You're sadly mistaken if you think'n that I'm not on my game boy
And thangs, just ain't been the same since the day that I came forth
You wear your heart on your sleeve, I sport that white tank boy
But you got a hard-on for me, what you holler'n my name for
It's your bitch on my dick, ain't my dang fault, man I can't call it

[Chorus]

[Eminem]
It's like we're playin'n lyrical tug of war with your ear
You hear it, girl come here, put your ear up to the speaker
Dear, while I freak this...world premier
Seducin' her, loosen' up with a little freestyle, what-wa wait am I'm lose'n ya?
Am I makin you look bad?
Well I got news for your homie you're lose'n her
Oh wait, she don't like when I spit it fast, I'ma try to show ya how
Let me slow it (down some)
It's still gonna be a blowout, you're gonna wanna throw out your whole album
Rummage through the shit and try to salvage something
To see if you can save any of it, bu-but none of it's fuck'n with me
Prick you really feel'n that bullshit, you think you kill'n them syllables
Quit play'n, these beats ain't nothing to fool with
They call me Fire Marshall, I shut the shit down
Your entire arsenal is not enough to fuck with one round (Woo!)
I am also the opposite of what you are like
You're a microcosm of what the fuck I am on the mic
I am awesome, and you are just awe-struck
She's love stricken, she's got her jaw stuck
From suck'n my dick, aw fuck

[Chorus]

    I'll Be the Shooter (Rick Ross Diss)
   </title>
   <lyrics>
    [Chorus: 50 Cent]
I'll, I'll be the shooter, I'll, I'll be the shooter
I'll, I'll use the pump, the taurus or the ruger
I'll pop somethin through ya, dirty is what I'll do ya
I'll, I'll use the cig, the pump or the german luger
I'll, I'll be the shooter, I'll, I'll be the shooter
I'll, I'll use the pump, the taurus or the ruger
I'll pop somethin through ya, dirty is what I'll do ya
I'll, I'll use the cig, the pump or the german luger
I'll, I'll be the shooter

[Verse One: 50 Cent]
I'll bang out, I'll, I'll, I'll bang out
Find out shit is real when I'm at you with that thang out
Cause all kind of commotion when a nigga get blast off
The spot we'll get his cash off that after no mask off
Pussy your heart pumpin but your brain gone
Think somethin sweet I snatch the heat and get the flame throwin
I stuff two different caliber shells in my revolver
Thirty eight, thirty two, Ross you got a problem
Start me I'll never stop I'm layin at your mama's spot
Squeeze till the llama hot I'll have your ass in drama ack
I'll cause havoc you come in my vicinity
Mother fuck the police officer Rick the enemy!!!!!

[Chorus: 50 Cent] (Lloyd Banks)
I'll, I'll be the shooter, I'll, I'll be the shooter
I'll, I'll use the pump, the taurus or the ruger
I'll pop somethin through ya, dirty is what I'll do ya
I'll, I'll use the cig, the pump or the german luger
I'll, I'll be the shooter, I'll, I'll be the shooter
I'll, I'll use the pump, the taurus or the ruger
I'll pop somethin through ya, dirty is what I'll do ya (YEAH!)
I'll, I'll use the cig, the pump or the german luger
I'll, I'll be the shooter

[Verse Two: Lloyd Banks]
Uh, it's been +Deeper than Rap+, I eat, shit, go to sleep with my gat
It's us three against the industry, let's keep it like that
Click-CLACK, getcha goons, fuck all the talkin
Niggas yappin 'bout who dress the best, get 'em Gucci coffins
When we tombstone, bullets hurt, 40s' break a few bones
Come around, ya fool! And my shorty's takin jewels home
Follow 'em then hallow 'em, take two these and goggle 'em
You ride wid 'em, you die wid 'em, chances of survival thin
The sharks is out you divin in? Dare you niggas try to swim
There's no odds, I gotta win, wobble 'em with the WHOP-WHOP
Shaky backgrounds, you probably with the cops
You ain't street, you need to stop, I breathe the hood, I be the block
Heater

[Chorus: 50 Cent] (Tony Yayo)
I'll, I'll be the shooter, I'll, I'll be the shooter
I'll, I'll use the pump, the taurus or the ruger
I'll pop somethin through ya, dirty is what I'll do ya
I'll, I'll use the cig, the pump or the german luger
I'll, I'll be the shooter, I'll, I'll be the shooter (Yeah!)
I'll, I'll use the pump, the taurus or the ruger     (Right!!)
I'll pop somethin through ya, dirty is what I'll do ya
(WE GON' RIDE ON ALL Y'ALL NIGGAS ONE BY ONE!!)
I'll, I'll use the cig, the pump or the german luger
I'll, I'll be the shooter

[Verse Three: Tony Yayo]
Niggas wanna kill me, I'm gettin money for God sakes
That purple-urple fucked Phelps up with Corn Flakes
Kick in the door man, big .44 man
Mortician morgue man, fill you with straws man
Black President, I voted for Obama
I voted in the hood, so I voted with my llama
Everyday is drama, everyday is karma
He got SHOT last week, so let's press his baby mama
That was home of the boldest, adolesence whylin
Shorty got killed, they burin sneakers on the island
+Maybach Music,+ y'all niggas want trouble?
I run up on that C.O. snap his ass in a bubble

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
I'll, I'll be the shooter, I'll, I'll be the shooter
I'll, I'll use the pump, the taurus or the rueger
I'll pop somethin through ya, dirty is what I'll do ya
I'll, I'll use the cig, the pump or the german lueger
I'll, I'll be the shooter, I'll, I'll be the shooter
I'll, I'll use the pump, the taurus or the rueger
I'll pop somethin through ya, dirty is what I'll do ya
I'll, I'll use the cig, the pump or the german lueger
I'll, I'll be the shooter

[Chorus: T-Pain]

Whoa oh oooh ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!!

All the above

[Verse One: Maino]
Listen! Really what do you see, when you lookin at me?
See me come up from nothin, see me livin my dreams
I've done been through the bottom, I've done suffered alot
I deserve to be rich, headin straight to the top
Look how I ride for the block, look how I rep for the hood
I got nothin but love, now that I come through the hood
Gettin this fortune and fame, will it make all of us change?
The new benz is all white, call it John Mccain
How the hell could you stop me? Why in the world would you try?
I go hard forever, that's just how I'm designed
That's just how I was built, see the look in my eyes
You take all of this from me, and I'm still 'gon survive
You get truth from me, but these rappers 'gon lie
I'm a part of these streets, till the day that I die
I wave hi to the haters, mad that I finally made it
Take a look, and you can tell that I'm destined for greatness

[Chorus: T-Pain]
Tell me what do you see (See) When you lookin at me (Me)
Whoa oh oooh ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!!
All I'm wishin to be (Be) What I'm destined to be (Be)
Whoa oh oooh ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I've done been through the pain and the sorrow
The struggle it's nothin but love (Nothin but love)
I'm a soldier a rider a ghetto survivor and all the above (HEY!!!)
All The above (OH OH!!!!) All the above (OH OH!!!!)
All the aboooooooooovvvvvvvvvveeeeeeeeee!!!!!
All The above (OH OH!!!!) All the above (OH OH!!!!)
All the aboooooooooovvvvvvvvvveeeeeeeeee!!!!!
All the above

[Verse Two: Maino]
It's easy to hate, it's harder to love me
Y'all don't understand, y'all quickly to judge me
Put your foot in my Nike's, picture you livin my life
Picture you stuck in the cell, picture you waistin your life
Picture you facin a charge, picture you beatin the odds
Picture you willin to bleed, picture you wearin the scar
Thank you for makin me struggle, thank you for makin me grind
I perfected my hustle, tell me the world ain't mine
You've been seein me lately, I'm a miracle baby
I refuse to lose, this what the ghetto done made me
I put that on my father, tryin to hope for tomorrow
When I think that I can, I envision Obama
I envision in diamonds, I envision Ferrari's
If the world was perfect, all my niggas behind me
Ain't you happy I made it? Man I'm makin a statement
Take a look, and you can tell that I'm destined for greatness

[Chorus: T-Pain]
Tell me what do you see (See) When you lookin at me (Me)
Whoa oh oooh ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!!
All I'm wishin to be (Be) What I'm destined to be (Be)
Whoa oh oooh ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I've done been through the pain and the sorrow
The struggle it's nothin but love (Nothin but love)
I'm a soldier a rider a ghetto survivor and all the above (HEY!!!)
All The above (OH OH!!!!) All the above (OH OH!!!!)
All the aboooooooooovvvvvvvvvveeeeeeeeee!!!!!
All The above (OH OH!!!!) All the above (OH OH!!!!)
All the aboooooooooovvvvvvvvvveeeeeeeeee!!!!!
All the above

[Bridge: T-Pain]
Now if I'm out on the spot (Spot) Or if I'm out on the block (Block)
I hustle hard cause it's all the time (They know, they know)
If you know that crime don't stop (Stop) Because I rose to the top (Top)
And eveybody knows my name (They know, they know)
Hey! I'm still grindin (Still grindin) Still hustlin (Still hustlin)
No more pain (No more pain) No more sufferin (No more sufferin)
My ladies and my shorties and my thugs
Keep on dancin and shinin for love

[Chorus: T-Pain]
All The above (OH OH!!!!) All the above (OH OH!!!!)
All the aboooooooooovvvvvvvvvveeeeeeeeee!!!!!

    Kay Slayed 'Em

   <lyrics>
    [Chorus: Sample Courtesy of Kanye West "Can't Tell Me Nothin"] (Uncle Murda)
'Cause after all of the drama, 'cause after all of the drama
'cause after all of the drama, Kay Slayed 'em
Kay-Kay-Kay-Kay-Kay-Kay slayed 'em, Kay-Kay-Kay-Kay-Kay-Kay slayed 'em
'Cause after all of the drama, 'cause after all of the drama
'cause after all of the drama, Kay Slayed 'em
(Get you hit with that Straight Stuntin Magazine my nigga)
Kay-Kay-Kay-Kay-Kay-Kay slayed 'em, Kay-Kay-Kay-Kay-Kay-Kay slayed 'em

[Verse One: Uncle Murda]
OH!!! Damn! If I aint the hottest
Then that mean there ain't no more roaches in the projects (PICTURE THAT!)
And man, If I ain't the realest
Then the cops who killed Sean Bell ain't no killers (You know they crooked)
I'm good for listenin while lettin my tek pop
If I ain't hit ya in the head I gave ya a neck shot (BANG)
And whoever I get on the track with
Better go hard and not spit no wack shit (GO HARD)
I'll put ya sixteen in the dirt
Just to get to my part, dudes will fast forward your verse
When your dead you just die you don't feel shit (YOU DON'T)
Rest in peace to homeboy I'm fuckin his bitch (I AM)
I'm lookin for a papi to front me them bricks (PAPI)
When it's bam back time I ain't up for no shit (I DON'T GOT IT)
He told his connect how I played him
He lucky I ain't pulled out that Kay and slayed him (AHHHHHHHHH!!!!!)

[Chorus: Sample Courtesy of Kanye West "Can't Tell Me Nothin"] (Mistah FAB)
'Cause after all of the drama, 'cause after all of the drama
'cause after all of the drama, Kay Slayed 'em
Kay-Kay-Kay-Kay-Kay-Kay slayed 'em, Kay-Kay-Kay-Kay-Kay-Kay slayed 'em
'Cause after all of the drama, 'cause after all of the drama
'cause after all of the drama, Kay Slayed 'em
Kay-Kay-Kay-Kay-Kay-Kay slayed 'em, Kay-Kay-Kay-Kay-Kay-Kay slayed 'em (Mistah FAB)

[Verse Two: Mistah FAB]
Cause after all of the drama still a piranha
Hated like Osama but loved like Obama
Raised by my mama in projects, pissy hallways
Gunshots they all day death seen it in broad day
Crackheads are wise but they don't use they wisdom
Rich people thinkin they riches, they can take it with them
Peep the prism that I give them my science, help build on them
In the days of swag rap, reveal skill on 'em
Park benches in neighborhoods I still chill on 'em
Knuckleheads get out of line, we pull the steel on 'em
Can't steal on 'em cause niggas they takin faves
You have to kill a nigga cause niggas ain't gettin played
Raised in the hood by the hoodlums, and ruffians
Niggas that didn't used to do nothin now they shootin men
Church boys turned to turf boys, it's the worst boy
Mama cryin in tears, her son on the shirt boy

[Chorus: Sample Courtesy of Kanye West "Can't Tell Me Nothin"]
'Cause after all of the drama, 'cause after all of the drama
'cause after all of the drama, Kay Slayed 'em
Kay-Kay-Kay-Kay-Kay-Kay slayed 'em, Kay-Kay-Kay-Kay-Kay-Kay slayed 'em
'Cause after all of the drama, 'cause after all of the drama
'cause after all of the drama, Kay Slayed 'em
Kay-Kay-Kay-Kay-Kay-Kay slayed 'em, Kay-Kay-Kay-Kay-Kay-Kay slayed 'em

[Verse Three: Grafh]
UH! Cause after all of the drama Kay slayed 'em
I StreetSweeped them I AK'd 'em
Bread ain't breakin a safe haven, I ate steak while they ate bacon
They fake they are Clay Aiken
Me and Kay Slay payed day in
Have your brain on the wall like one of Kay Slay's spray paintings
How you made they made day in I rep Jamaica Queens
Like the E, and the F and the J train station
Whoever try and play, they racin up the highway to heaven
Try to take Satan on vacation (Amen)
I hate hatin (Huh) I whip it whip it while I'm flake bakin
I put a grip up in the Playstation (Nice)
This is niggarific (Huh) This is dedication (Yes)
This you gotta sniff it (Sniff) This is medication (Oh)
When this get in your system (Huh) This is penetratin
It gets you wicked or when your ventilatin.....BREATHE

[Chorus: Sample Courtesy of Kanye West "Can't Tell Me Nothin"]
'Cause after all of the drama, 'cause after all of the drama
'cause after all of the drama, Kay Slayed 'em
Kay-Kay-Kay-Kay-Kay-Kay slayed 'em, Kay-Kay-Kay-Kay-Kay-Kay slayed 'em
'Cause after all of the drama, 'cause after all of the drama
'cause after all of the drama, Kay Slayed 'em
Kay-Kay-Kay-Kay-Kay-Kay slayed 'em, Kay-Kay-Kay-Kay-Kay-Kay slayed 'em

    [ INTRO: JUICE ]
Ey
I swear there's nobody in the industry fuckin with Chicago rap niggas
Believe me
I give it to you niggas if you want it
This for you, Va
What up, P

[ VERSE 1: JUICE ]
I'm the grimiest nigga
With the weapon I'm smackin ya
A Legend like Acura
Plus I'm ryhmin with vigor
With a better work ethic they say I mighta been Jigga
There's no regrets, the flow is wet, my nigga, cry me a river
Exceptional vernacular, weapons spectacular
And I'm never satisfied, somebody grab me a Snicker
Named J-U-ICE like the diamonds that glitter
When rhymin in a blizzard, seein me's like tryina get a lining with scissors
Plus I'm throwin back a fifth of that Dom, my nigga, it's fryin my liver
Supplyin the piff and ( ? ) infinite
I don't even gotta try to get ignorant
Like Theo and Vanessa dad I can deliver it
Plus I do it just to brag, I am a intricate rhymin wizard
Intravenous dope up in every rhyme and I'm spittin it
It's like I'm puttin coke in every line and you sniffin it
Plus I carry a nine, Terry Shine, I'm rippin it

[ VERSE 2: Rhymefest ]
I am not here to spit metaphors or create dances
I am a can of whoop-ass ready to open
Willin and hopin you would provoke him
Try to insult me, I will punch you in yo face until my fists start smokin
Till my hands start soakin in the blood from the wounds that was open
From the shit you was talkin out of motion
I'm emotionless, I beat you to a Pulp for yo Fictional
Some old John Travolta shit, hocus pocus, bitch
It's the magic show, spooks disappear down the rabbit hole
LJ guerilla warfare, my shit's tactical
I hold grudges, ( ? ), do not touch it
Fuck with, walk away from me, man, say "Fuck it"
You don't want it, get stomped by the Brown Hornets
Vakill, Crooked I and J, we all on it
Keep your friends close, your enemies closer
Fuck that, kill your enemies, yo, this ain't Oprah
We gon' ride

[ VERSE 3: Nino Bless ]
Look I don't give a fuck, my motto is live it up
Keep your glass half full, see mines, I fill up
You want war, please give it up, the gig is up
I'm sick enough to penetrate ( ? )
Yes it's Brooklyn's crooked minister
Spit conscious shit, then push some kush when I finish up
I administer the sickest of scripts since
That Indian that wrote the script to the Sixth Sense
You lames spittin should quit and go back to 'caine, bitches
Is you insane, you must ( ? ) simpin
Got your blood on my blade drippin, I ain't kiddin
I pierce your chest like a ( ? ), you lay stiffen
Dog, I stay trippin, you know I was playin, pimpin
I end his life cause this wasn't in G and Kane's vision
Yeah I'm game uptown for that same mission
Aim-clickin, bang-spittin, flame sick as Twain's diction

[ VERSE 4: Crooked I ]
Yeah, even though I'm holdin hot burners
This killer is colder than hyperthermia
A single round spin'll sit you down like a hernia
Me and Rihanna, we got a seperate definition for 'disturbia'
I'm mentaly disturbed, nigga, I murder ya
That prrrat put a peephole in your flesh
A keyhole in your chest
Then I open up your torso
Just like a door, so
Death can walk in
Negro, I'm depressed, please know I'm a mess
Send you right upstairs
Gun treat you like them Billie Jean sidewalks, the way they light up squares
Yeah, kill kickdrums, tie up snares
Wanna describe my flow in one word? Try 'unfair'
Tireless nights I spit fire into wireless mics
Till I expired its life, until my life expired I'm fly as a kite
And I'm firin iron that'll turn any Iron Mike into Brian McKnight
Mmmwwaaa, good night

[ VERSE 5: Vakill ]
I'm hate's Cupid on a poison-tipped arrow assignment
Strapped to the ( ? )
My barrel alignments never minded enough exposin bone-marrow confinement
Non-rhymers' subsconcious is vicious
Only pussy gettin past these bars is conjugal visits
Ganja exquisit, when inhaled conjure a vision
Explicit as point blank with a rocket launcher ( ? )
My physic's the Lord's best kept secret, swept under His rug
Cracked the earth with a thunderous tug
I work wonders with slugs, I'm a blunder with blood
It will spill until the angels come and plunge in the flood
( ? )
This that new Chi, necks frosty, bars is Windex-glossy
Next costly mistake I'm squeezin Tecs ( ? )
Any nigga that plans to ex-off me
Ain't got two snowballs chances on a anatomically correct Frosty
You ain't heard no bars that's inhuman and wild
Mushroomin a cloud till all you bitches consumed in a pile
God and Satan reunion is now
And if Obama gets shot there'll be more blood in crackers than fuckin communion allows
Can't shit breathin dishonour these verses
Only cracks you'll find in my arm is 2 for 5's if the fuckin economy worsens

(Armor of God)

    Sharpshootaz Blastic' Caps
   </title>
   <lyrics>
    [Canibus]
Sharp fangs~! Sharpshootaz... sharpshootaz
The poem is dolioform
I arm wrestle you with my polio arm in a rodeo barn
Nowadays I see emcees get on stage
They look like parakeets in a cage
Grab the mic like they afraid to palm it
'til I bomb it, the LRADs lace the target
The firearm long like fist-to-armpit
Sergeant Sharpshoota, a gifted marksman
Sip sake, rip the mic nigga watch me
The kamikaze, Benihana your body
Sour posses show up to your party
Everybody go home now, put your microphone down
Go boil some water, I'ma hold him down
Interrogation techniques, I'ma show you how
I'ma ask you two times, then after that
I'ma roll you a blunt with a blasting cap
You understand what I'm sayin? Your man's not playin
You'll be twenty-one grams lighter after the weigh-in
Sharpshootaz aimin, wolfgang came in to bang him
Demo'd the nigga, then Maintain sprayed him

[Maintain]
Yeah I sprayed him, it was strictly biz
The way I laid him to rest yo it wasn't cause I hated him
His bars were sendin him off, he was lost
Now he's, six feet deep payin the cost
Yo my enemies are unfit; they keep movin
like they don't know I'm too strategic for this dumb shit
You're hopin that I fail; but the race is been won
But they don't know that because they slower than a snail
It's too easy, but I don't feel guilty
Cause if the slowpokes had it their way they would kill me
Now how real is this situation that I stay in
And when does a Sharpshoota got time for playin?
My whole team aimin them red beams, it's no games
It takes me no brains to leave you with no brains
I got you so pegged this is so unfair
You should start prayin to the man upstairs
Cause really all I gotta do is cock and squeeze
And your brain's on the ground lookin like cottage cheese
While I'm in the trees with top notch emcees
Sharin brilliant ideas and philosophies about
how we're gonna stack this money and lounge
In the town there's a whole lot of nothin around
Try to stop the process, and I'm huntin you down
to put your faggot ass in front of the ground, now fuck around

[Chorus: Canibus] + (K-Solo)
The Sharpshootaz, it's the Sharpshootaz
Blastin at the blastin cap, bomb unit
It's the Sharpshootaz, it's the Sharpshootaz
Nothin but sharp fangs, paws and claws, let's do this!
(It's the Sharpshootaz! It's the Sharpshootaz!)
(If it's a mission that we on you know I mapped it out)
(It's the Sharpshootaz! It's the Sharpshootaz!)
(My whole team'll have you street dudes tappin out)

[Willie Dynamite]
Yo, me fall off in the game, picture that~!
You got beef in the street? And need heat?
Call your man I get you that
I got small ones that go pop pop, and click clack
And big ones strong enough to push a bus back (BOOM!)
And I still ain't forgot what you said nigga
I'm down to turn that white tee you rockin
into a ketchup bed
When the slugs, catch up, to yo' head
Hip-Hop you dead a closet casket you gon' rock instead
So tell your mans ain't no need for sendin flowers and shit
When I'm on the fiends come through and devour the shit
The block is dry, leave it up to us to shower the shit
You got beef, I slide through and Twin Tower your shit
Dynamite, I'll harass you niggaz
Like pullin your shorts down in front of chicks
I'll embarrass you niggaz
Actin like you John Gotti, we'll see how gangster you are
when you find pieces of your son's body
I fucked around and ate his lunch, now he got his hands full
holdin his head and legs in the trunk
The chick I'm with, I ain't hearin the bitch
I'm rockin Sharpshoota shit, lookin for the next gear to switch

[Born Sun]
Aiyyo I squeeze on emcees like bullets never-ending
Leave the machine smokin while the terror still spinnin
Mujahadeen from Queens, an Arabian God
Suicide bomb your squad screamin Allahu Akbar
Hell gon' unleash release for beast wars
Mad rapper with a backpack strapped with C4
Barack Obama that popped the llama
And bodily harm ya, shots penetrate your armor
The young Yaphet Kotto in the dojo blowin 'dro
Clappin the fo'-fo', wanted for murderin the flow
Crazy muh'fucker I'm sick, it's been known
Rhymes retarded and bars is downs syndrome
I'm top raised to hit front page, up center stage
with the gauge, that'll remove your hips from your legs
Back crackin vertabrae, attack and murder prey
Don't ever war with Sun, I swore I thought I heard him say

[Chorus]

[K-Solo]
None of you niggaz in the block want beef
You get slammed on your face like you fightin Tito Ortiz
Plus I, wreck shop, your man'll hear your neck pop
I do your whole clique with a 8 ball in a sweatsock
I draw the line, cross it, you get shot
My wolves'll leave the mountain and scatter the whole block
I get the Mac out, splatter the whole block
Come mad a whole lot, I said it to get it hot
I wrote it so when I quote it I spit it, went POP
You can disrespect me but not when I'm holdin the glock
I paint my name on your back like connect the dot
And YO~! I'll get that movement in your neck to stop
These motherfuckers know the fuckin deal
See I don't fuckin sleep, you know my fuckin hand be on the steel
Quick with ammo, come equipped
when I squeeze the infra from the hip {*echoes*}

[Chorus]

    2010 Rap Up
   </title>
   <lyrics>
    (Do you got Skillz?)

[Intro - Skillz - talking]
Aight, it's time to get in, ha
Now where should I begin?
To run back the ratchetness to 2010
Profound Sounds, y'all cut the track up
I'm a get it in, this the twenty ten Rap Up

[Verse 1 - Skillz]
Now Waka Flocka went hard and got shot in the paint
Kelis went a little harder, took Nas to the bank
All that bread on the monthly? Son that's crazy
Did I mention the fact she only had one baby?
Then the 'quake hit Haiti and left us in awe
So pray for them and pray you never see the things they saw
+We Are The World+ got made, just to donate bucks
No "I" in we though, I just think we fucked that up
Sade came back and blessed the world with her gift
John Mayer went there and let the N word slip
And Yung Berg got robbed by his peers
It's not '09 though, he just seems to do that every year
50 Cent tried to take out Ross
Look like it ain't work Fif, you might have to take that loss
Rozay, he had some heat
Had everybody from the 'burbs to the streets thinkin they was Big Meech
Ross had a good year, that's fact
But him baggin Stacey Dash? Mmm, I don't know 'bout that
Now I might sound thirsty
But Erykah Badu's video? Woo, Lord have mercy, mmm
And I don't mean to sound foul
But if I could hit that, I'd dress up like a clown right now (right now)
So don't tempt me, ha
And nobody had one, but we was rappin 'bout +Beamer, Benz and Bentleys+
Mel Gibson, spazzed out for real
Idiots of the year? BP, for the oil spill
And Wayne went to jail for his gat
They said he had a music player, where he hide that at?
No matter where you looked, it was hard to miss Drake
But easy to miss 50, when he lost that weight
LeBron made a Decision, that move was bold
But he had to take the heat, once the Heat got cold
Hey Cleveland, I'll holla
'Bron's the reason a hot dog in Cleveland'll cost ya eighty-four dollars
The iPhone prototype, that got jacked
Shout to rappers that was dumb enough to touch Kat Stacks, mmm
I know what ya thinkin kid
And no, I didn't touch her, but I know a lot of rappers that did
Kanye had Twitter goin nuts
Man y'all funny, since when you cared about the World Cup? (uh)
Facebook, talk of the town
And don't lie, you know you was cryin right along with Chris Brown
But in the New Year, what I don't wanna see
Is Montana Fishburne or a movie in 3D
And Swizz wifed Alicia Keys
The volcano cloud had me and Jazzy Jeff stuck overseas
And rappers, they weren't excitin
But I'd hate to see your parents if you came out lookin like 50 Tyson
And Antoine Dodson, that was just trife
With all that "hide ya kids and hide ya wife"
Man, the industry sucks
'Cause we started off laughin at both of them but now they laughin at us
Ha, I'm just askin
How Lady Gaga could wear some raw meat but y'all call that fashion?
And Fantasia, she went the suicide route
Oh, you gon' kill yourself, before your album come out?
Lil Wayne came home like jail was a fad
They sold us big iPhones and they called 'em iPad's
And we all got barraged
By the many faces and many voices of Nicki Minaj
Old girl got it in, ha
And before the year was over she was already beefin with Kim
Lindsay Lohan, behind bars
I guess I wasn't supposed to notice that a dancer won "Dancing With the Stars"
The census came tryin to get the count right (uh)
And Paris Hilton, well she got caught with the white
And Petey Pablo, need a reverend
Dog, a gun? In an airport? On 9/11?
Obama still tryin to do his thing
They caught T.I. with three pills and sent him back to the bing
Miley Cyrus, had us at a loss for words
A lot of y'all got addicted to Angry Birds
The miners got freed, live on TV
Y'all could of gave 'em somethin, maybe a Double Down from KFC
YouTube views, that could get ya some bread
Ask that little white boy with the real big head
Usher came back and still claimin King
He signed Justin Bieber though, can you say cha-ching?
Willow +Whipped Her Hair+ and hit the perfect score
Rather see hers, than anybody on Jersey Shore
Republicans, ha, they still trippin
A WikiLeak? Nah, where I'm from man, we call that snitchin
Raz-B and Chris Brown, they had some words
I got three for Raz-B Â you got served!
I hear a lot of Rap Ups gettin made for real
Ehh, he's alright but he's not Skillz
With that being said, I send a R.I.P
To Guru, Gary Coleman and Miss Teena Marie
Apache, Eyedea and Lena Horne, the star
Huddy Combs, Hideo and Cool DJ Law
May they all rest in heaven
The Rap Up is wrapped up, I'll catch y'all in 2011

    '08 Rap Up
   </title>
   <lyrics>
    [Skillz]
Yo, it's that time, we bring the past back up
Ya boy Skillz, you know my ass gon' act up
And this year was jacked up, but I got the facts up
Here we go, Scrap - this the "'08 Rap Up"
If you a Patriots fan, you was quick to cheer
'Til the Giants pulled off the "Upset of the Year"
And the commercials was lame as hell
Poor Marion Jones, she had to watch the game from her cell
"Detox" was gettin recorded
and Dre put out some headphones, but he was the only one that could afford 'em
Wayne got bagged for havin herb
and Nas try to drop a CD that was called the N-word
I chilled on the word, I was fine
'til I saw him at the Grammys, I was like, "This nigga lost his mind!"
Ne-Yo toured with Kells, and he got played
50 Cent, he kicked Paris Hilton off stage
Game went to jail for eight days
You know it's bad when JoJo faint and K-Ci leave him on the stage
Jay-Z and Mary J. doubled they bread
Shout out to Prodigy and Remy Ma, hold ya head
"A Raisin in the Sun?" You lied
I heard that and I thought Flavor Flav got a show outside
And wrestling look faker than ever
I mean, WHO was gon' believe the Big Show couldn't beat Mayweather?!
Now Nick &amp; Mariah, they kept it G
But the "Wedding of the Year" goes to Hov &amp; B
The unity in G-Unit is gone
'cause it's a sad day when you got Young Buck cryin on the phone
("I'm just being confused!")
Ice-T and Soulja Boy - dumb!
And who was the fool that threw a bottle at KRS-One?!
The Sean Bell verdict was lame
And 50 went to Africa but he ain't come back with his chain
Wayne dissed the DJs', what was that 'bout?
Then the barber from L.A. straight knocked Suge out
Tough street +Lookin' Boy,+ the guys that made that song
They lookin like no second single +Lookin' Boys+
And lemme say this, don't it feel good
to say BIG UPS - TO ALL MY HAAATERS!!
The beef gotta stop, G
Fif', you runnin out of people man why you pickin on Rocsi?
The "Baby Mama" came out
And we ain't never find out who really burned down the house
Rick Ross took it too far
Was it me, or he was the biggest C.O. that we seen thus far?
I'm just askin
and Bow Wow got his ass handed to a him in a game of Madden
You wanna know what's funny? (What?)
They showed this to Game, but they ain't never say who got that money
Heh, the system is filthy, for real G
How the hell R. Kelly come up not guilty?
I can't believe he walkin, on TV
Talkin 'bout ("When you say teenager, how old are we talking?")
Wayne sold +A Milli+ in a week
and in seven days, I got sick of the "A Milli" beat
Da Brat doin time served
And '08, was almost a good year for ya man Yung berg
Between fights and his fanbase, he needed some help
Then his chain went on tour, by itself
Will Smith got Hollywood on smash
Puff, you a millionaire man, why you cryin 'bout gas?
Katt Williams, he went nuts
and the econmoy was harder than McCain tryin to put his arms up
And Palin, I ain't gon' discuss her
Heh, she prol'ly on the porch now, tryin to look at Russia
And Kanye, he went for broke
Maybe the album should've been called, "808 and No High Notes"
Heh, naw he doin his thang
Is it hard to fight paparazzi when you got on skinny jeans?
Nelly and Usher couldn't find their fans
Superhead said, "I'm pregnant" - I'm like by who, the pregnant man?!
T.I. got back in gear
Beyonce "Single Ladies" - mmm, "Video of the Year"
Heh, it had the guys gettin hyped together
I hope DMX finally get his life together
Man, we got to kill all the drama
Biggest moment EVER - Barack Obama ("Yes, we can!")
First black president, please believe it
I'm just happy that my granny got a chance to see it
It's time for a change
So don't gon' try to turn the inauguration into a All Star Game
Let's act right, and show these kids
We can turn "Yes, we can!" into "Yes, we did!"
And Bush made it hard
Be patient, let that man go into the White House and do his job
Black athletes, y'all gotta parle
Don't play, you saw how they came back for O.J.
The economy, that's a wrap no doubt
The whole world in debt, how the hell you bail that out?
Halle Berry, she had a baby on the low
The best thing on TV was Keyshia Cole show
Lookin good, Keyshia, but don't thank me
You ain't the star of the show, that would be Frankie
("HOLLAAAAAAAAAAAAH!" "Man down!")
It's a +Crazy World+, Jeezy told ya son
"Crazy World?" I wonder where he got that from?
I gotta say it, 'cause he influenced the game
but I gotta give props to the boy T-Pain
And y'all in his lane
with songs like ("OHHHHHHHH!!!!! We pop champagne!")
So I'ma say this quick - (We in a recession!)
Stop lyin, y'all ain't poppin shhhh!
And President Bush so hated
He wnet to Iraq and almost got a-shoe-sinated
Heh, so I'ma shout out to board
And shout out to err'body upstairs who ain't wit us no more
So y'all stay on your grind

    Evening News
   </title>
   <lyrics>
    [Chamillionaire]
Welcome to the evening news, I thank you all for tuning in
Yes, I'm your host and your journalist, Chamillionaire, so let the news begin
Our helicopters out in the streets look at the screen, an' let's zoom it in
'cause Cashis is live at the scene, hey Cashis how are you my friend?
Got no time for no interviews (go-got no time for no interviews)
No time to trip don't be confused, cause this type of news depends on interviews
Got no time for no interviews (go-got no time for no interviews)
You know I keep my ear to the streets so it's up to me to bring you the truth
I saw a movie were George Bush had a bearded man on his squad
So much power from oil money that poor folks can't sit by him
No problem, Osama, Bin Laden, Been hidin'
So long that them pictures all starting to look like him on them milk cartons
Don Imus made comments that made everybody forget about him
That's him, Anna Nicole got pregnant and had kids by him
Rest in peace to Virgina Tech, too many innocent kids dyin'
Well let's just blame hip-hop and act like that's the big problem

[HOOK]
Now I would give you news about Katrina
but you know I can't talk about Katrina
'Cause every time I talk about Katrina
they look at me like it's a misdemeanor
Anyways, there's way more important stuff that we can discuss
George Bush is playing golf, everybody hush, he's about to putt

[CHORUS]
Gas prices raises, the money keeps burning
Dropout rate rising, so what are they learning?
Sending the troops in the war so I turn it
To today's evening news
And the world keeps turning slow (turning slow, turning slow)
As the world keeps turning slow (turning slow, turning slow)
As the world keeps on turning slow (turning slow, turning slow)
This is your evening news

[Chamillionaire]
I know you take offense to certain words
I've heard worse, but I wouldn't blame ya'
They say he's a entertainer, don't worry about it, never mind Kramer
The Crocodile Hunter got stung, and the lion turned on the lion tamer
We keep sending troops to Iraq, I figured that we must like danger
Little kids don't learn in school they go to school to go spray a gun
If you a parent, then be a parent, get off the couch and go raise your son
Kobe just broke another record, today's game he hit 81
Now they saying he's number 1, but yesterday they all hated him
OJ was named innocent, he got no sentence, he's still alive
It's very ironic that the lawyer that defended him had to die
Well, now my cue card says the price of gas isn't really high
But I'm not going to read that, 'cause we all know that that's a lie

[CHORUS]
Gas prices raises, the money keeps burning
Dropout rate rising, so what are they learning?
Sending the troops in the war so I turn it
To today's evening news
And the world keeps turning slow (turning slow, turning slow)
As the world keeps turning slow (turning slow, turning slow)
As the world keeps on turning slow (turning slow, turning slow)
This is your evening news

[Chamillionaire]
We still haven't found Pac's killer, still haven't found Biggie's either
30 minutes into the case they got tired and took a breather
Snoop Dogg just got arrested, everyday he gets a new subpoena
Innocent when murder was the case so the prosecution got a middle finger
Hip-Hop is sweeping the nation, but the contents seem so degrading
Most rappers got new albums that white kids are anticipating
If you don't like it on the radio or the television then switch the station
Flavor Flav get a lot of ratings, Bill O'Reilly somewhere is hating
Kanye just said WHAT? the president ain't got time for that
The White House is going to stay white even tho' we know Obama's black
9/11 was a calculation, and some would say it was a timed attack
He gave a speech on CNN, "They bombed us, now we're bombing back"
Where the heck is Osama at?

[HOOK]
Now I would give you news about Katrina
but you know I can't talk about Katrina
'Cause every time I talk about Katrina
they look at me like it's a misdemeanor
Anyways, there's way more important stuff that we can discuss
N'SYNC makin the band and Milli Vanilli have broken up

[CHORUS]
Gas prices raises, the money keeps burning
Dropout rate rising, so what are they learning?
Sending the troops in the war so I turn it
To today's evening news
And the world keeps turning slow (turning slow, turning slow)
As the world keeps turning slow (turning slow, turning slow)
As the world keeps on turning slow (turning slow, turning slow)
This is your evening news

    Mind On My Money
   </title>
   <lyrics>
    [Intro: Nicki Minaj] + (Brinx) + {Busta}
I got my mind on my money, and I'm not goin awayyyy
So keep on gettin your paper...
(F'real ye ain't never had to tell me get this bread)
(*"HOLIDAY SEASON!"*) {Busta Bus} Nicki Minaj
(Billions baby) Frank Bill-ion (C.I.T.)
(*"This is a world premier"*) (Let's get it)

[Brinx]
Now behold it's your excellence, C.I.T.C.
I'm oh-fourward slash president, Eastside resident
It's oh so evident! Brinx Billy ride cousin
Black on black Phantom, 26's on the side of 'em
Ninas on the side of 'em, Goonies on the side of 'em
Anybody get it boy, be careful on the side of 'em
These niggaz'll bury you, guns no fear of you
Money hungry honey with me holla she gon' carry you
Flyer than a aerial, there I go, jet-to
Sittin on my feet when I'm stuntin on them people
I tell no fables, e'rything tailored
Fax machine, OfficeMax, see me for that paper
You workin with short bread, ain't my money long youngin
Bitch I'm 'bout trappin more digits than a phone number
Different time zones on 'em, kill these niggaz lyrically
Left side of my closet look invaded by italy
Right side Paris, left side flaggin
Oaper is is my main chick me, and money married
(PAPER~!) And that's all a nigga know bitch
That's why these brand new niggaz is on my old shit
(*"HOLIDAY SEASON!!"*)

[Nicki Minaj]
Guess what I did I came out of the truck?
In the lane like I just... I chunk my deuces like...
That's all I do like... Young Money
Nicki Minaj, is the ninja
Harajuku Barbie all that like y'knahmean?
Like yeah that's what we doin gettin money like y'knahmean?
You writin disses we gettin money!
Yeahhhhhh boyyyyyyyyy!
(*"Trapaholics mixtape"*)

Get me my limousine, all in your magazine
And when I come them better lean like Promethazine
Dem no say Nicki nice, I'm 'bout my money momma
And tell Michelle I got my eye on Barack Obama
Tryin to get that Madonna, you know Hannah Montana
Could find me sittin indian style with the Dalai Lama
Konichiwa I get my yin then I say sayonara
I'm meditating I'm in cahoots with a higher power
Mind on my money mind-mind-mind on my money yeah
Mind on my money mind-mind - Nam Myoho Renge Kyo
Mind on my money ay, mind on my money babe
How does this money taste, wine and gold money's face
You see the signs and the teachings
If you ain't know well this is grinding season
Now and go get your gangs signs, throw it up
Where all my niggaz on them bikes? Throw it up
We don't care what you say, we ain't goin away
My niggaz bring the heat, and it's not a summer day
So mind on my motherfuckin money
My mind on my motherfuckin money
Ohhhh

[Busta Rhymes]
Aiyyo I speak foreign languages and shit
But the language I speak best is that money language
Hahahah~!! Flipmode bitch!
Brinx I like how we doin a Brinks truck job on these niggaz homey
Time after time again I love to tell niggaz
and remind niggaz, how I hold out on motherfuckers

Niggaz out here frontin 'bout they bread they can't trust a nigga
My money so stupid call me Warren Buffett Busta nigga
Gladiator toss, see everything about me butters
Countin money so long that I'm seein dollar signs in different colors
My money'll smear and smother yo' money, you hear me brother?
Been about that bread like I was broke and I'm still in the gutter
And in case you ain't knowin there will be no replacement
of the bags of that "Arab Money" I got stashed in the basement
Face it; whenever I shine I glisten, whenever I talk you listen
Ain't no money gettin made in these street without my permission
I keeps it drug infested, my money is well connected
It's to the point where my +Conglomerate+ is well +Respected+
You need to check my method; I promise you I'll be the wrong nigga
when it comes to my money that you ever want to mess with
Grind like missionary labor, holdin dignitary paper
You ain't know? My team is filled with consiglieres
We major! I don't give a fuck about your stipulations
Type of bread appropriate for E'RY situation!
You can tell from the jewelry that's sittin on my collar
From the bread to the crib niggaz KNOW I'm all about the dollars

You know I ain't into all of this long talkin shit
Shit is confusin me when I'm countin paper, hahaha
Brinx! Busta Bus bitch!
You know I only wanna inspire y'all to get it like how we get it
You know it's a recession out here, we all need to get it
So when we walk around we ain't gotta look like foolish niggaz

    Ice Cream Paint Job (Westcoast G-Mix)
   </title>
   <lyrics>
    (G-MIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIXXXX!!!!!)

[Intro: Dorrough] {Snoop}
Hah! {West Coast, baby..}
Yeah, remix! This time I say
Yeah, buddy - live good, eat good
Old school Chevy to a Cadillac Fleetwood
Got the inside - (black!), and the outside (black!)
Thinkin 'bout a Maserati, but I rather ride ('Lac)
A.C. blow (whaaat?!), like wind chill (chill!)
Paint drippin like the rain on a windshield

[Chorus]
Cream on the inside, clean on the outside (REMIX! Hey!)
Cream on the inside, clean on the outside (REMIX! Hey!)
Cream on the inside, clean on the outside
Ice-ice cream, i-i-i-ice cream paint job
Cream on the inside, clean on the outside (That girl...al-rite)
Cream on the inside, clean on the outside (That girl...al-rite)
Cream on the inside, clean on the outside
Ice-ice cream, i-i-i-ice cream paint job

[Dorrough - Verse 1ne]
M-m-m-mama black, daddy black
Uncle black, granny black, catch me in a Cadillac
(Cadillac) Say, ridin on a foreign ti'
wit some ice cream paint, got the shoes and I had to match
My car, yo we stunt like that (like that)
Down in Dallas, Texas, yeah it's crunk like that
All I gotta do is this, drop the top and show the wrist
And I can pull a bad chick off eye contact
Yeaaaaaaa - it's ya, it's ya, it's ya boy Dorrough
I got a wood grain wheel and a wood grain flo'
Paint job, fresh sprayed, pop trunk, might wave
Yeah, buddy, I'm paid, umm, everybody know
that gettin money is the mission, it's the auto clone magician
0-9, but I drive a 0-12 Expedition
wit a auto-start ignition, fo' fifteens hit it
Wit a sign on the back say "Let's go fishin"

[Chorus 1/2]

[Snoop Dogg - Verse 2wo]
Yeah, West Coast nigga...
Cream on the inside, clean on the outside
Twenty-fo' on the ol' schools sittin up high (high)
Push - I hit the gas, fuck a red light
All chrome Chevy signs on my tailpipe
I smash out Doggy Dogg live the +Boss' Life+
Show these niggaz what it cost and how to floss it right
They hear the song and they Jerk to it all night
Euro grill, candy paint drippin off white (drip, drip, drip..)
Yeah, we got the streets turned up
Purp in my blunt, brown in my cup
Boat motor in my engine, 15s' in my trunk
Ice Creams' on my feet, I'ma fuck the streets up
(Fuck it up!) Wet paint job, shift kit, no clutch
Pocket fulla money wit some Hustle Boy Chucks
Sugar coat seats, soft white crust
They say they ridin clean, but they ain't got it like us!

[Chorus 1/2]

[Nipsey Hu$$le - Verse 3hree]
Look, look...
It's 15s' in the trunk, let my beat bang (yep!)
Half of chicken on my neck, let my chain hang (yep!)
Fo fifty yellow rock'll make the ass swang
Chevy tuned up, bangin Hu$$le is my last name
For the rap game, still us in the fast lane
Pulled up at the spot, parked the Regal on the grass mayne
Swisher Sweets same color as the wood grain
They say, "Why you leave it runnin?" I say "Cuz I'm in the hoooood, mayne~!"
Clean on the ourside, cream on the inside
Ask around, bet they tell you that I been fly
Way befo' Xzibit show, I had a +Pimp Ride+
And "All Money In" is the motto that we live by
Look, shit kept gettin betta fo' me
You hatin on me? It's whatever, I get cheddar, homie
I'm well-paid so the people know me
Ridin wood grain and leather only...
Hu$$le

[Chorus 1/2]

[Jim Jones - Verse 4our]
Splash - (candy bought) I'm drippy
Car so clean that the paint looks slippy (Hold on!)
Caught the swag flu so I got these niggaz sick-y
Coney ice cream teh way the girl started lickin
(Baskin Robbins) Give her the shovel the way she diggin me
(Dig that!) +Victory+ - (Ow!) Just the +B.I.G.+ in me
Yeah, my game fly, I make the nasty girls get wit me
(Nasty!) And after the telly, it's all history
(Gone!) Chickens - rotisserie
We can make it snow muthafucka, betta getcha skis (We got it!)
Told her turn it up as I hit the speed
Push the head down, word is bond as I hit the weed
(Uh-ohhhhhh)

[Soulja Boy - Verse 5ive]
Yeah shawty, Soulja Boy big dawg
Black-on-black Lamborghini, ice cream paint job
WOOOSH! Black card bank card
So much money, look like I had the bank robbed
Flow cajin, spicy punchline
Disrespect me, get jumped like the lunch line
Titanic swag like I'm standin on a boat
Man ya boy's got money, but ya flow still broke
No pad, no pen I'm goin in
Flyin down the highway, blowin on a Kush-ington
I'm gettin money like I never would believe
So many tattoos that my skin cain't breathe
I'm gettin old money but I'm a youngsta
My swag presidential make Obama wanna sponsor me

[Chorus 1/2]

[Outro: Dorrough]
Ha, yeaaaaah!
REMIX! Say, we ain't doin it big
We doin it major, ya feel me?

Fifty thousand feet in the air and I'm still on my mobile
Fuck talking bout the recession the shit's depressin

And I , chill with the thugs and the gangsters too
I ain't a blood but I'm warrin with the boys in blue
Crooked officer!!! crooked officer!!!
Why you wanna see me in a coffin sir?!

[Verse 2]
That bloke from Oasis said I couldn't play guitar
Somebody shoulda told him I'm a fuckin rock star
{*imitating "Wonderwall"*} Today, is gonna be the day
That I'm gonna throw it back to yoooooou
I'm livin life as a rocker, I'm like Pimp C, pat'na
Comin down in Mercedes, peelin off on the boppers
Worldwide show, I'm comin down in a chopper
Hundred eighty-thou screamin "Hov!" with the Roc up
It's too easy!!! I got ladies on shoulders showin me they chi-chis
I met honey at the show last year
And now I'm actin brand new like a +world premier+
Yeah, I know life ain't fair
But chill, baby girl - MY GIRL IS HERRRE!

Dancin off-beat, but they know the words to my shit!

[Verse 3]
You ain't gotta jock Jay-Z, jock fly shit
You ain't gotta jock me, homey, jock my chick
Jock her cinatti, she +Body+ you with her fit
No that's not Pilates, her body is just thick
You ain't gotta jock her nigga, jock my clique
Jock the dope boys 'cause we all tossed bricks
Federallis jock me while I'm crossin the bridge
Click, click - take a portrait of this
I ain't no pretty boy I got a georgeous wrist
Cut handsome checks and my flow's pretty, sick
I'm some ghetto chic, I'm where the hood and high fashion meet
Oooh wee I'm like the camouflauge Louis
How you niggas want it the tux or the toolie?!
Haters, I ain't mad at you
If I wasn't I probably jock me too

[Chorus: Sample from "Dumb Girl" by Run-D.M.C.] (Jay-Z)

(*Oh oh oh!)
(I need everybody put your hands up, wave from side to side right quick for me)
Slow down HOV your killin 'em

[Verse 1: Jay-Z] (Swizz Beatz)
Yeah! You would think I was on 'roids
I been hittin so long and I'n a big headed boy
Nah we ain't on HGH
Though I might pick up some weight when I'm runnin through your state
(Runnin through your state!) Nah nah nah we ain't on the clear
We on the runway in back to back Lairs (In the air!!!)
Yeah Yeah! It's Ms. No More Drama
And Barack Obama rhymers feel honored (Talk to 'em HOV)
I put my life on these tracks
You act like y'all don't wanna p-pay me for the facts
Luckily my therapy is to rap
I just bare my soul I don't expect nothin back (Get it up!)
Your all welcome long as you felt them
I was 'gon get mine you know where the hell I'm from
I'm from the bottom so I do this from the diapers (Stinky!!!)
Quick fast turn the big apple into cider (Nasty!!!)
I do this, I'm a writer and a rider
Spew it cause I'm nicer but I do this for the lifers (Tell 'em again Hov!!!)
I'm a writer and a rider
Spew it cause I'm nicer but I do this for the lifers, your welcome

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige - singing in tune of Slick Rick's "La Di Da Di"]
To all of y'all, keepin y'all in health
Just to see you smile and enjoy yourself
Your ahhhh-lll..., your ahhhh-ll

[Swizz Beatz]
Hands up, hands up, hands up, high!
Hands up, hands up, hands up, high!

[Verse 2: Jay-Z] (Mary J. Blige) (*Swizz Beatz)
Yeah yeah, you probably never see again

Viva Hovito bandito muy bien
Big up to Biggie and Pac, I do it for them
Until I rich Kaleek, I do it for him
Do it for those who can't do for self do to the pen
May these bars reach through your bar
And ma, when Mary sing it heals your heart (*Hands up!!)
God so Lisa Stansfield you are
Love Is A Battlefield we all get scarred (*OH!!!!)
AH! I put my heart into this
This is much more than marketed music
The reason I got a market to do this
As there's people goin through pain I'm just walkin 'em through this
(I'm here for you) This ain't no marketed music
People goin through pain I'm just talkin 'em through it, your welcome

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige - singing in tune of Slick Rick's "La Di Da Di"]
To all of y'all, keepin y'all in health
Just to see you smile and enjoy yourself

Your ahhhh-ll are welcome (Slow down Mary your killin 'em!)

[Verse 3: Mary J. Blige] (Swizz Beatz)
If it wasn't for your love it would all be a dream
And you made our dreams come true
That's why y'all don't need to thank us
Cause we do this all for you (Talk to 'em Mary!)
We know what you were goin through
Because we were goin through it too
When no one seems to understand
We were always there to hold your hand

[Verse 4: Jay-Z] (Swizz Beatz)
Sure I taught you 'bout watch brands and watch bands
I also said watch the man hoppin out of vans (WOO!!!!)
I ain't only teach you about Efizel
I told you how to fish and not let other niggas feed you, your welcome

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige - singing in tune of Slick Rick's "La Di Da Di"]
To all of y'all, keepin y'all in health
Just to see you smile and enjoy yourself
Your all are welcome, your all are welcome, your all are welcome

    Hot Shyt

   <lyrics>
    [Intro: Peedi Crakk]
Hot shyt, hot shyt, come and get it, come and get it hot shyt, hot shyt
Come and get it come and get it hot shyt, hot shyt
Come and get it come and get it hot shyt, hot shyt

[Verse One: Peedi Crakk]
Come and get it, I don't know what the fuck to do wit it
I wrote it down, took it to the studio and spit it
I tried to knock it in the game, a soccer, they ain't kick it
I twist it up in the dutch, mental lit it and hit it
My girl won't lick it, my moms won't cook it
The cops won't book it, my squad ain't wit it
I shot a point black where the cage is still live in
I try to take it to Jamal and pray that they'll send us
Playa plies won't rip it, icepicks won't pick it
I took it to Jigga, he couldn't do nuttin wit it
I threw it in the river, motherfuckers started swimmin
I bagged it up, put it on the block and couldn't flip
Who the fuck gon' buy it? The Roc won't drop it
Maybe if I put up "For Sale" sign, somebody cop it
State penitentiary cellblocks can't lock it
Hot shyt, bitch, DJ Screw can't +Chop+ it

[Chorus: Peedi Crakk]
Come and get it come and get it hot shyt, hot shyt
Come and get it come and get it hot shyt, hot shyt
Come and get it come and get it hot shyt, hot shyt
Come and get it come and get it hot shyt, hot shyt

[Verse Two: Black Thought]
Uh! Come and get it, who want it I got it I'm runnin with it
I brung it from Philly Philly where the crimes get committed
Them rhymes is terrific, beyond scientific
I took it up in a gym, nobody couldn't lift it
Where the hell I'm 'gon send it? Will people 'gon dig it?
I took it to Rich he said it's somethin wrong with it
He took ut to ?uestlove, he on the phone with it
He took it to Pitchfork, he couldn't get a sentence
Who the fuck 'gon touch it? If Snoop won't puff it?
The streets don't love it, your peeps won't plug it
I took it to Jigga he said it wasn't in the budget
We took it to Jazzy Jeff, the brother couldn't cut it
I wonder who 'gon knock it, the world 'gon rock it
The squad 'gon pop it, your girl 'gon jock it
I lost my wallet, glad I had it in my pocket
When I'm up in the party, come and see me get retarded HOT!!!!

[Chorus: Peedi Crakk]
Come and get it come and get it hot shyt, hot shyt
Come and get it come and get it hot shyt, hot shyt
Come and get it come and get it hot shyt, hot shyt
Come and get it come and get it hot shyt, hot shyt

[Verse Three: Tuphace]
Yo, come and get it, I admit it, I spit it kinda diff-er-ent
They, try to put me in the box, I wouldn't fit in it
Coke - wasn't shippin it, dro - wasn't hittin it
But flippin them downloads and folks stay clickin it
Labels won't push it, T-Pain won't hook it
{?} campaign, straight George Bush it
Showed it to John McCain, said it wasn't crooked
Opened the champagne when Obama ran and took it
The kids won't heat it, the blogs gon' delete it
I sent it to L.A., the nigga couldn't +Reid+ it
I gave it to MJ and my homie couldn't +Beat It+ (Hee-hee!)
I showed it to Stevie and he said he couldn't see it
Where the hell I'm gon' spread it? My city don't get it
The radio gon' edit, the journalists won't sweat it
Dig it, I don't give a SHIT about a critic
I'm young, fresh, and gifted and I spit it how I live it
Come and get it!

[Chorus: Peedi Crakk]
Come and get it come and get it hot shyt, hot shyt
Come and get it come and get it hot shyt, hot shyt
Come and get it come and get it hot shyt, hot shyt
Come and get it come and get it hot shyt, hot shyt

[Verse Four: Young Chris]
Uh! My pops wouldn't raise it, Just won't +Blaze+ it
Judge wouldn't free it, Charles couldn't see it
And even if they had the horiscope they couldn't read it
He took it upon his self since Def Jam won't release it
Said the artist couldn't paint it, a poet couldn't speak it
Bullet couldn't seek it bad karma couldn't reap it
Said the farmer couldn't grow it, the cleaners couldn't sew it
Johnny Depp couldn't +Blow+ it, B.E.T. wouldn't show it
Said the law couldn't cuff it, my lungs wouldn't puff it
Tone couldn't +touch+ it even the phone couldn't crush it
Said a holster couldn't tuck it Superhead can't suck it
It's born to rock on, explosion, one of the toughest
Said the barber couldn't cut it, rain couldn't flood it
McCain can't beat us so Barack had to lead us
It's the Roc motherfuckers, G-shots, undefeated
This flow is so insane T-Wayne Couldn't Believe it
MOTHERFUCKERS!!!!!!!

[Chorus: Peedi Crakk]
Come and get it come and get it hot shyt, hot shyt
Come and get it come and get it hot shyt, hot shyt
Come and get it come and get it hot shyt, hot shyt
Come and get it come and get it hot shyt, hot shyt

[Verse Five: Wale]
(Kill it!) Okay, Peedi said kill it, euthanasia's in the building
And Wale been on his business since Gang of Six kill it
The people gon' feel it, a leader win the building
A leader to my people, niggas hate it just a smidget
The city can't stop it, no keys gon' lock it
Believe I been popular, the freaks who been pockin
The beggars can't borrow, the record sales drop
And name another new nigga wit a sicker Twitter follow
And the politics are part of it, the radio ain't on it
Promoters say that most of them are 'fraid of my performance
I'm flawless wit the spittin, the rappers don't live it
My {?} lenses. my infrared sixes
My infrared maxes and I ain't even matchin
So gonna bring the bitches, and Peedi bring the Backwoods
And I'ma get some action, who said I won't do it?
I'ma take you out the game, you +Mutombo+ to it
Muthafucka!!!

[Chorus: Peedi Crakk]
Come and get it come and get it hot shyt, hot shyt
Come and get it come and get it hot shyt, hot shyt
Come and get it come and get it hot shyt, hot shyt
Come and get it come and get it hot shyt, hot shyt

    [Eminem]
Ohh! Told you! Game over!

[Royce Da 5'9"]
Uhh, Ryan's a homicidal misfit
I write the solution to biophysics on the side on a cliff in some heiroglyphics
This my admission to havin violent psychotic wit
Devour polish it, politics
By the way I'm higher than the Eiffel Tower tip
I like writin but I will stick this pencil in ya ass before I write ya shit
Pause, inhalin hella kush
Us and Yelawolf like a heavy foot, gas pedal push
Felons crooks, goin door to door like we sellin books
Dolly Parton style, melons mushed
Now my bitch dancer, I'm 'bout as sick as cancer
If you could swallow my style you'd probably rip ya pants up
If you could bottle my style and sell it to somebody
it'd probably'll smell like cologne made out of bits of panther
They call me anchor man, I hold down the ship
Leave you niggaz floatin in water then go and drown a fish
Fuck! I'm fuckin heinous, I'll make you fuckin famous
Your lead showers is comin, fuck is you sayin?

[Eminem]
FUCK, it's fuckin rainin; SHIT, it's lightning
BITCH, it's thunderin, cause I'm cussin up a storm if you wonderin
Shit, SHIT! You couldn't muster up enough thought
to take a dump turd or brain fart, jump if you want
Urine in your face, all you had to do was say
that you wish you would've just stayed pissed off in the first place
We came to monopolize the game, Illuminati is here
Yeah, human oddities, at odds with us just why it's gotta be
Cause we started out cold and it snowballed, we froze
Soon as we rolled up, on these hoes
Alls we is know y'all lowered the bar like limbo, you know who you are
So quit fuckin the dog 'fore we start callin you Bizarre
Shit, screwed the pooch, y'all done raped the pitbull
Fell in love with a Shih Tzu, this missile's directed directly at you
And as for these hoes who don't know me from a can of paint
You must be huffin, fuck a ball sack if your taints can't take you on a date
You mistake me for a gentleman, you're 2000-and-late
Man I'm will.i.AIN'T!
I'm the bad guy - type of guy that'll drag five girls up on stage
Pour ice in their pants, and the first one who pees, gets a black eye!

[Chorus: Eminem]
You must be out of your mind
You think you're fuckin with us
Suck on these nuts
Bitch hang it up, this game is over

[Joell Ortiz]
Puffin loosies watchin "I Love Lucy" with Gary Busey
Crazy! How the fuck could you son me? I'm Shady!
Will there ever come a day where they could slay me?
I don't know, fifth month, black and yellow insect, maybe!
'Til then I kill the bad man tryna slay me
E'rything you kick weak, you speak kung fu-gazi
All my homeboys, 2.0 boys
Nickel I just picked up a Phantom, look how it Rolls Royce!
Even if I wanted to quit I ain't got no choice
Verses keep comin, I should invoice my own voice
You should see the kind of asses that my pole hoists
Hoes be like diamonds in your chain mayne, so moist
Bang bang, bang bang! House Gang, chainsaw
Here to kill you pussies, don't ask what we came for
I write 'til my right arm vein's sore
Forearm feel like Thor's arm in a gang war
You hear that YAOWA you know who finna file out
Definitively finish you, my fist stick out that agua
Piranha mentality with a Jaws bite all night
Comin up never saw light but never lost sight

[Joe Budden]
Jets and movers, cesspool-ers, meth abusers
Wish death to us, tecs rugers to respect they shooters
My men think in sync, roll with the best crew
Must move to the beat of the same drum without Lex Luger
Welcome to nay hood, bigger than 'jects
Cheated death multiple times without riggin the deck
So I'm well-prepped if you just want war
There'll be blood e'rywhere, you'd be layin on the Louboutin floor
It's raw, but keep actin like you don't know Mouse nigga
And you gon' need the best doctors, House nigga
Guard your jewels and avoid large tools
Cause after I spill you at the light you'll be in the carpool
Keep your distance from idiots, cause the truth told
They food for thought's rotten, they gems are fool's gold
Need results from my actions, mistakes I'll exonerate
I'm Martin King starin at a picture of Obama's face
Talkin funds, niggaz ain't never seen stock
I don't need the key to the game, I pick a mean lock

[Chorus]

[Crooked I]
Take off, you invited inside of the mind of a psychotic rhymer
I'm kind of a - Dahmer!
I'm grindin up rappers, I'm linin up jackers, I'm climbin up ladders
I buy enough clappers to retire you factors, fire at drama
You liars and actors, I'm the genuine article
But read me wrong, get my gun to split you to particles (particles)
Tell me when and I'm there
Not only heir to the throne, but my chair is suspended in air
Stay fly like unlimited fare
You got us pegged wrong, my circle don't fit in with squares
I smell shit and piss, know where it's comin from?
You stepped on #2, just to be #1
Now I'ma step on you, bring it to yo' yard
Bogart for ours, we go hard
You frauds just blow hard like broads, I coast guard the West
I'm Mozart, I compose dark shit with no heart

[Yelawolf]
I got Jim Beam in the liver, gettin head like clean clippers
With haters on my dick like a jean zipper
But I throw up 16's like I drink liquor
You think you seen sick? Well BITCH you ain't seen sicker
Then I'll, crack and then I'll hop around in a hospital gown
Poppin the trunk, my pumper stay cockin the rounds
I shit logs and I piss, river brown
Cause I drink creek water and spit the river Nile
And that's as close as I get to a pyramid
Shit, they think I'm Illuminati, so fuckin ignorant
Shit with a grin, here with this pen, so innocent
But when you win they say you a sin, but in the end
They jump on the bandwagon and dance to the band playin
Skinny ass, pants saggin, it's only yourself you're playin
Call me a clown but you love what the clown's sayin
in them freak shows at the county carnival, then you payin
Bitch I'm on a trapeze with no legs in the dark yellin "Go Shady!"
Drivin slower than an old lady
In an old '89, no piece if you pay me
Give me peace sign on my grille, no Mercedes
I'm gettin paid for these shows that I throw lately
Same shows a year ago would've broken most of you crazy
They call me crazy cause I made it
Bitch you crazy cause you quit, look at my clique lady!
You ain't fuckin with Budden, you ain't got no choice with Royce
You don't wanna see the Crooked I, or listen to Ortiz voice
That dirt road hit the 8 Mile, the point-oh boys
And if Marshall want me to clap, then homie I deploy
Game over!

[Eminem]   Yo I don't think they heard you, tell 'em again
[Yelawolf] Game over!
[Eminem]   Ha ha

    Hot Shyt

   <lyrics>
    [Intro: Peedi Crakk]
Hot shyt, hot shyt, come and get it, come and get it hot shyt, hot shyt
Come and get it come and get it hot shyt, hot shyt
Come and get it come and get it hot shyt, hot shyt

[Verse One: Peedi Crakk]
Come and get it, I don't know what the fuck to do with it
I wrote it down, took it to the studio and spit it
I tried to knock it in the game of soccer, they ain't kick it
I twist it up in the Dutch Master lit it and hit it
My girl won't lick it, my moms won't cook it
The cops won't book it, my squad ain't with it
I shot it point blank with a gauge it's still livin'
I tried to take it to Jamal and pray it's still sinnin'
Vampires won't rip it, icepicks won't stick it
I took it to Jigga, he couldn't do nothin' with it
I threw it in the river, motherfuckers started swimmin'
I bagged it up, put it on the block and couldn't flip it
Who the fuck gon' buy it?
The Roc won't drop it
Maybe if I put up "For Sale" sign, somebody cop it
State penitentiary cell blocks can't lock it
Hot shyt, bitch, DJ Screw can't +Chop+ it

[Chorus: Peedi Crakk]
Come and get it come and get it hot shyt, hot shyt
Come and get it come and get it hot shyt, hot shyt
Come and get it come and get it hot shyt, hot shyt
Come and get it come and get it hot shyt, hot shyt

[Verse Two: Black Thought]
Uh! Come and get it, who want it I got it I'm runnin with it
I brung it from Philly Philly where the crimes get committed
Them rhymes is terrific, beyond scientific
I took it up in a gym, nobody couldn't lift it
Where the hell I'm 'gon send it? Will people 'gon dig it?
I took it to Rich he said it's somethin' wrong with it
He took it to ?uestlove, he on the phone with it
He took it to Pitchfork, he couldn't get a sentence
Who the fuck 'gon touch it? If Snoop won't puff it?
The streets don't love it, your peeps won't plug it
I took it to Jigga he said it wasn't in the budget
We took it to Jazzy Jeff, the brother couldn't cut it
I wonder who 'gon knock it, the world 'gon rock it
The squad 'gon pop it, your girl 'gon jock it
I lost my wallet, glad I had it in my pocket
When I'm up in the party, come and see me get retarded HOT!!!!

[Chorus: Peedi Crakk]
Come and get it come and get it hot shyt, hot shyt
Come and get it come and get it hot shyt, hot shyt
Come and get it come and get it hot shyt, hot shyt
Come and get it come and get it hot shyt, hot shyt

[Verse Three: Tuphace]
Yo, come and get it, I admit it, I spit it kinda diff-er-ent
They, try to put me in the box, I wouldn't fit in it
Coke - wasn't shippin' it, dro - wasn't hittin it
But flippin' them downloads and folks stay clickin' it
Labels won't push it, T-Pain won't hook it
? campaign, straight George Bush it
Showed it to John McCain, said it wasn't crooked
Opened the champagne when Obama ran and took it
The kids won't eat it, the blogs gon' delete it
I sent it to L.A., the nigga couldn't +Reid+ it
I gave it to MJ and my homie couldn't +Beat It+ (Hee-hee!)
I showed it to Stevie and he said he couldn't see it
Where the hell I'm gon' spread it? My city don't get it
The radio gon' edit, the journalists won't sweat it
Dig it, I don't give a SHIT about a critic
I'm young, fresh, and gifted and I spit it how I live it
Come and get it!

[Chorus: Peedi Crakk]
Come and get it come and get it hot shyt, hot shyt
Come and get it come and get it hot shyt, hot shyt
Come and get it come and get it hot shyt, hot shyt
Come and get it come and get it hot shyt, hot shyt

[Verse Four: Young Chris]
Uh! My pops wouldn't raise it, Just won't Blaze it
Judge wouldn't free it, Charles couldn't see it
And even if they had the horoscope they couldn't read it
He took it upon his self since Def Jam won't release it
Said the artist couldn't paint it, a poet couldn't speak it
Bullet couldn't seek it bad karma couldn't reap it
Said the farmer couldn't grow it, the cleaners couldn't sew it
Johnny Depp couldn't +Blow+ it, B.E.T. wouldn't show it
Said the law couldn't cuff it, my lungs wouldn't puff it
Tone couldn't +Touch+ it even Bone couldn't Crush(er) it
Said a holster couldn't tuck it Superhead can't suck it
It's born to rock on, explosion, one of the toughest
Said the barber couldn't cut it, rain couldn't flood it
McCain can't beat us so Barack had to lead us
It's the Roc motherfuckers, G-shots, undefeated
This flow is so insane T-Wayne +Can't Believe It+
MOTHERFUCKERS!!!!!!!

[Chorus: Peedi Crakk]
Come and get it come and get it hot shyt, hot shyt
Come and get it come and get it hot shyt, hot shyt
Come and get it come and get it hot shyt, hot shyt
Come and get it come and get it hot shyt, hot shyt

[Verse Five: Wale]
(Kill it!) Okay, Peedi said kill it, euthanasia's in the building
And Wale been on his business since Gang of Six kill it
The people gon' feel it, Alido in the building
A leader to my people, niggas hate it just a smidgen
The city can't stop it, no keys gon' lock it
Believe I been popular, the freaks who been poppin'
The beggars can't borrow, the record sales drop
And name another new nigga wit a sicker Twitter followin'
And the politics are part of it, the radio ain't on it
Promoters say that most of them are 'fraid of my performance
I'm flawless wit the spittin, the rappers don't live it
My ? lenses. my infrared sixes
My infrared maxes and I ain't even matchin'
So gonna bring the bitches, and Peedi bring the Backwoods
And I'ma get some action, who said I won't do it?
I'ma take you out the game, you Mutombo to it
Muthafucka!!!

[Chorus: Peedi Crakk]
Come and get it come and get it hot shyt, hot shyt
Come and get it come and get it hot shyt, hot shyt
Come and get it come and get it hot shyt, hot shyt
Come and get it come and get it hot shyt, hot shyt

    Who Killed Hip Hop
   </title>
   <lyrics>
    [Intro] [Joe Budden speaking]
Yeah, I mean ah, I'm doin' all these interviews.
Everybody want to know what I think of the state of hip hop.
Whether I think it's dead or not.
Question ain't whether it's dead. It's more like, who killed it and when.
Let' go.

Can anybody pinpoint the day it when wrong?
I mean, I used to blame Raggaeton
I can't front I thought all that was corny
Was it Ja's fault?
Lil' Mo said she didn't get paid for +Put It On Me+
Look, bring it up and dudes get on some coy shit
Was it T-Pain with that funny voice shit?
Or was it Lil' Wayne with that funny voice shit?
The whole game did grow that funny voice shit
"I can't tell when it happened
Was it when Lil' Jon showed dudes you can sell without rappin'?
Was it +Laffy Taffy+? I thought they was kiddin'
Shawty Lo said "No I really didn't."
"Dancing became cool again, Nick Can +Walk It Out+
But I didn't know what the fuck niggas was talking bout
Unit kick Game out, they didn't give a fuck
Then we seen the same shit happen to Buck
It was a few years ago, but I remember the summer
50 made fans start looking at the numbers
A&amp;R won't take risks, they won't sign niggas
The worst swag came out and started to blind niggas
Rap dudes want reality shows
And my dumb ass was thinking that reality sold
Did it start with the Ipod
Or when rappers had to pay DJs to do they job
I mean all the content is the same it won't differ
Everybody sold some drugs or pulled triggers
The more you think about it you gonna get sicker
And why the fuck would Nas want to call his shit Nigger?
Nigga
Was it when it the Wu broke up?
Pac, Big , Big Pun went to sleep and never woke up
Lupe was doing a tribute and choked up
And some of these stupid ass fans were like "So what?"
Some of them, they ain't educated
And fuck blaming the south, we ain't segregated
I'm mean, it was all good around the Kiss and Beans shit
Took a left turn around the kissing green shit
Maybe it all started, when Rocafella parted
Ways, it's natural to shift toward fame
I watched every last dude shit on Dame
Kinda got that in common, I can dig that pain
When they gave Jay a desk and suit
They finally gave a rapper a chance to come execute
But somethin' told me the suits at the table was hurtin'
They fired everybody and labels started merging
As far as sales, they declining strong
Ask the experts they'll say that the climate's wrong
I'm mean some niggas prime is gone
I peeped it when niggas started putting fake diamonds on
You could tell a dude "I spit better than you"
But then he'll say I'm richer for whatever I do
I seen all this coming, I knew what we was in fo'
Back when Erick Sermon had jumped out of the window
Was it when Ma$e retired and couldn't hack it?
Tip could he just needed some more rachets
DJs, producers wanted to get us the farthest
Said fuck rappers and started becoming the artists
I gotta talk candid
Did we start having issues around the same time Jimmy and Cam did?
Was it when Chingy thought he didn't need Ludacris
Next album found out that was ludicrous
Papoose and Clipse both survived
Inkin' with Jive
Then getting jived
Ya man J-Hood repped that D-Block gang
Then I seen dude dragging his D-Block chain
Or did one hit wonders change it all along
They made labels only want to sign a dude's song
And you really don't know shit
If you think the fans pick the videos on 106
I'm just stating the truth
Did it start when Fox stayed in the news more than she did the booth?
Or was it when Lil' Kim stopped exploiting sex
And fuck is up with DMX?
I hope dudes straight
Have an opinion and they're going to say "you hate"
I can't front, I'm missin' them old Clue tapes
The underground sunk further
The Feds was on Irv so the Inc dropped Murder
I never blamed Fab, Jeezy, Rick Ross
The shit gets lost when Shyne went up north
I never understand the hip hop police
When hip hop is what hip hop needs to police
These blatant ass radio attempts sound so bland
Twista kept trying to recreate +Slow Jamz+
Did we send the wrong message with our slang
As broke niggas spending their rent to +Make It Rain+
And you walk in give a bitch a few 20s
And she'll smirk her face up, looking at you funny
This chick told me see only take new money
Man I snatched my shit back so fast
Or did it start when rappers said "Fuck it"
Sacrificed music, starting raping their budget
Nothing wrong with dudes being candy or pop
Something wrong when Joc did the +Candy Shop+ (Fuck is wrong with him?)
We buying our own records maybe no one's to blame
Are we a business that we can't afford to maintain?
The second week show you that that boys numbers ain't hot
I hate to break it to you numbers always lie
Or when Ortiz signed to Aftermath
And now he's feeling the aftermath
Was it Fight Klub fucking with them battle raps
But not many of them getting signed after that
I mean, some can't stay afloat
A million Busta albums, he's still not mentioned with the GOATS
Fuck looking for answers
Time will tell
Was it when Def Jam didn't want to resign L?
A 15 year old told me Cash? was ass
But rather then smash on dude all I could do was just laugh
Or was it when the whole east coast fell off?
Or got comfortable, maybe dudes was too well off
The more that niggas said that they didn't write their own lyrics
The more it started to sound like it didn't
But, do whatever you can to keep the lights on
But dumbing down just became the new Dylan
Honestly I ain't know what to think
A few years ago we had the young kids wearing pink
I can't blame the fans for not knowing a damn thing
When we trained them to be this way
I mean showed them whatever to sell with no limits
Since the early '90's sold them a false image
So when some shit come that don't fit the mold
It's like a mole, nigga you won't even do gold
They watch the videos
See you on the corner with a whole bunch of people and think that you good
They turn on the TV and see these video vixens
And think nigga's girls really look that good
I mean they get so many free verses
When the album drops shits more like a bonus
Why pay for it, why take on this
With one click of a mouse they can own it
I mean some of them are fooled so easily
By whatever we say or we show em on TV
But that was all part of the plan
Or was it when Eminem made 'Stan' I swear some of these fans
They put their whole life on the line
It's like they can't like more than one rapper at a time
Less about the product, more about the digits
It's a business, we got less fans and more critics
Maybe we at a cross
Canibus made one of the dopest diss records but some still say he lost
I ain't believe my ears when niggas tried to tell me
That KRS One had a rap beef with Nelly
If rap was alive
We'd be trying to be the best rapper ever
Not the best rapper alive
But you won't get accepted at all if you ain't street tough
Onyx was the hardest til Sticky got beat up
Now I'm a thug is how I gotta behave
If I wanna be paid, if I wanna see praise
You know something is wrong when niggas is gettin shot
And you gotta sit and wonder if the whole thing is staged
It ain't real no more
Or did we just expand on the audience, maybe we appeal to more
Or
Did we just think y'all getting dumber?
We tried to make gettin' older gettin' younger
Did we lose our hunger, somethings gotta give
Did we out grow ourselves, is hip hop for kids?
If it is, they turn on MTV cribs
And think that's where these motherfuckers really live
Or was it when Lauryn Hill dropped a classic
So did the Fugees til Wyclef tapped it
Songs don't do it no more, this shits shocking
Seen it when +Lean Back+ had the whole world rocking
Now it's fuck your bars if your hook is fly
So we look at Crooked I with a crooked eye
It's dope ass rappers that ain't seeing no dough
If everything is commercial where the fucks the show
But anybody making a dime, see I'ma wish well
Still we took a big L losing Big L
Or was it when Youtube came in the game
Now nobody's from their living room can make a name
Or when the indies like Koch came and blew up
Niggas at the majors they literally threw up
To some it ain't fun no more
You know it's fucked up when DMC don't talk to Run no more
Too many egos like we ain't one no more
Shits predictable, niggas ain't stunt no more
We started to see shit we never seen before
At one point we even had the magazines at war
Or
Was it street DVD's like Smack
Showed you just how stupid your favorite rapper would act
Did shit get lifeless
When MTV made a list of the hottest and ignored the nicest
Changed the whole stee-lo
I mean the average fan never heard of a Goodie Mob or a Cee-lo
But they've heard of Gnarles Barkley
And Dr. Carter still say we got a heart beat
I ain't gonna lie, I was scared to death straight up
Started hearing rumors of an Outkast breakup
I was like that ain't true, it sounds desperate
Started seeing Big Boi and 3K separate
Had periods we was dryer than the desert
Are we all killing this shit, is it a group effort
Are we alive and well or barely surviving
Is it R&amp;B's fault, them niggas is thrivin'
And then a lot of people go and blame Limewire
I don't think it's downloading, dog the lines tired
Did the fans just get tired of the outcome
One dope single and a bullshit album
So they share albums with each other
Was it Master P with them ugly ass album covers
Or was it when we started appearing in the news
Timberland said they ain't want black niggas wearing their boots
I mean, I know it got foggy at least blurry
When a label dude got knocked out by Keith Murray
Or was it when we became obsessed with the brand names
Had the kids trying to buy shit they can't name
And some think the evidence is ample
Did it start when Puff took advantage of the sample
Is it all watered down with no fire
If you had enough money you could buy a ghost writer
Or the diamond district, Jacob The Jeweler
Had to buy his watch to be looked at as cooler
And fucking with them trends
Our stupid asses wasted a hundred grand on shit that ain't even in
Look, is the game now as bad as it's ever been?
It's not ring tones just the songs that they represent
I heard all of them
Sad part, I wouldn't recognize most of these niggas if I saw em
I can't explain it, i don't know what to tell ya
Now going gold is looked at as a failure
Maybe old heads in charge just weren't able
DJ's are spinning now with no turn table
Maybe the fans are just bored of us
Or maybe there ain't enough room for all of us
It's like, even a friendship will stop at a point
Mike Jones went platinum off of Slim Thug's joint
But there's so many ways to get fucking rich
Superhead kicked off just by sucking dick
Did we sell out just to get in demand more
Did we go against everything we use to stand for
Both are likely
There's two sides to the coin, who you rolling with Soulja Boy or Ice T
Some niggas wanna sit around and complain about
I'd rather analyze, seek how it came about
If we could rewind the world
We wouldn't have to watch Flavor Flav try to find his girl
Look, today it's all about marketing and promo
I remember VH1 was just for old folks
But no ma'am
If I ain't know better I would think that mix show was now program
We let the power of a dollar annihilate us
How the size of our chain gon validate us?
It's simple they can't think we really deep
I just heard Chris Brown on the +A Milli+ beat
Seen a video called +Looking Ass Niggas+
Grabbed the remote, tired of looking at niggas
But that let a nigga know that if we ain't dead
That we just half alive, maybe brain dead
Did it start when Capone left NORE
Nah he went to jail that's a whole different story
Or maybe something really wrong with our ears
Obie Trice got dropped, so much for Cheers
Female emcees, they don't ever hit the target
Somebody said they seen Amil working at a Target
The sad part is we already lost Remy
Or did we go wrong when E-v-e got Skinny
What's up with Jacki-O, Rah Digga that I can't figure
Trina ain't been the same since +Nah Nigga+
I know it had to do something to his heart beat
When Lady Of Rage started doing Steve Harvey
I know we caught a little trauma
Somewhere between Yo Yo Boss and Lil Mama
A lot of females found another way to extort
Most of our video models have turned escort
Do anything to see dough
So they'll exchange sex with an artist or director for a lead role
Or should we get back to basics
Wheres the Rakim's or the Masta Aces?
The Big Daddy Kanes, or did we never recover?
From Dre not being on the side of Ed Lover
Or when rap dudes started signing their friends
Instead of going out trying to find niggas with skill
I seen it when D-12 put out +Purple Pills+
While the whole hood laughed them niggas sold a mil
Some of us ain't prepared for something so lucrative
I just heard Yung Berg say some stupid shit
Like we almost caught one in the torso
When each Bone Thug member took they own +Crossroad+
Some disagree, some gotta see the same
Or maybe hip hop died on Aaliyah's plane
If it relocated, where did it move to?
I Still Love H.E.R. the way Common use to
Or did Bill O'Reilly come fuck up the spirit
With negative remarks about everybody's lyrics
He spends all his time dissing us
Nigga, you 95 years old motherfucker shouldn't be a listener
Lost Jam Master who was Tougher Than Leather
Or did it start when Treach was fucking Pepa
As our jeans got tighter and our T's got longer
Tryna figure out which age group we belong to
Or did we all go astray
The second Dr. Dre left N.W.A.
In my opinion we was on easy streak
When he was beefing with Eazy-E
Or did we get fucked up when producers found a way to cheat
Signin' unknown niggas to start making their beats
If you sell your own shit, it's gotta go for cheap
Just put my name on it so the price increase
Or is it cause everybody's so self centered
Is that the reason hip hop itself ain't centered
Or have we already seen the shit with our own eyes
With +Rico Suave+, Cam and Vanilla Ice
Everybody want in the game so in return
You got label executives fucking they interns
And anybody looking at that new Vibe Bracket
Should see that they don't know a thing bout this rap shit
Or maybe we should've stopped being proud
When their was no more Rawkus and no more Loud
Try to get conscience around Vote Or Die
So they made it look like all our votes was lies
As the years go on it's like we keep getting more voids
We got lost when we lost one of the Lost Boys
I knew we was impersonating a fraud
When Kay Slay smacked my mans at the awards
Regardless it's our fault as artists
Running with entourages who act like they ain't never left the projects
Who do we wanna target?
Will they put an Uncle Murda Cd in a Wal-mart or a Target
We got the nerve to not wanna hear Ras Kass
But fuck with Vick get silly and that trash
I felt ashamed
When J-Kwon told me he didn't like Raekwon cause he stole his name
Was back when everybody in the club got Tipsy
Now every contract gotta be three sixty
So fuck eating, better scrape the plate
Now every beat gotta at least have an 808
Did the light skin jim when we first heard Mims
And said another New York rapper on the south's tip
Is it overcrowded
They keep saying if it's so fucked up, then do something about it
I doubt it, It's just one thing they don't understand
That job is way bigger than just one man
Or maybe all of these pleas that it's deceased
Is false and this shit is right where it needs to be
Maybe we built on something that'll last forever
You see Face and Geto Boys just got back together
Maybe no one can stop us
Even other genres now jock us
We even doing songs with the rockers
Hows that the feeling?
Kanye is amazing
Wayne just sold a million, we closer to the ceiling
God we in a coma
When we the only business where you can excel with no diploma
Technologies changed, made everything simple
Myspace is now a dudes Bio/Demo
Side from the fact we generating more money
We took it global and penetrating other countries
So lets celebrate, sip some Cris
Some more shit we embraced just to end up dissed
Go and buy the bar out so we can all get bent
Lets go cop a bunch of cars just to still pay rent
Or here's another bright idea to entertain
Lets go and put our face on the bottom of a chain
Or some of us are just nigga rich with nigga money
While Jews keep laughing lookin' at these nigga dummies
Hip hop is just a stepping stool
Til we find another role we can step into to
Some of us doing movies as a matter of fact
And some never stop the plan life after rap
I mean ah
As I'm older we stopped moving further
Around the same time Snoop Dogg went on trail for murder
Or was it Scarface creating these cloneys
Thirty years later everybody's still Tony
Maybe anyone complaining is deranged
Can you expect something to grow and not change?
Which results in our exceptions, deviated our old route
To simplify the term, we all sold out
I think I figured out who's to blame
We started out Obama ended up McCain
So we Kurt Cobained ourselves when we defeated
So next time they asked you who killed it say WE DID
