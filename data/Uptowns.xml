Verse 1: (B.G.)

I reside in the same place nigga UPT
Represent the same war VL 13
Still carry mine tighter niggas real B.G.

Now Cash Money is my home til I'm dead and gone
Disrespect you get split cause you know right from wrong
Imma stand my ground be all I can be
And shoot down everybody player hatin' me
I den been alot of places I strapped around
But I never found a town like Uptown
Out lounge all day smoke weed by the pound
I cruise all day through the project bumpin' my sound
All these stunners hit it 6 under the ground
You were on the front row wearing that black gown
These rookies reppin' I done saw more what ya'll den seen
Don't let me catch ya down bad from the 3 to the 13

Chorus: (B.G.)

Uptowns my home that's where I do my dirt
I either hurt or get hurt it's me or you on that shirt
Watch that infra red on Sunday it's going down
Look I never found a town like Uptown

Uptowns my home that's where I do my dirt
I either hurt or get hurt it's me or you on that shirt
Watch that infra red on Sunday it's going down
Look I never found a town like uptown

Verse 2: (B.G.)

	<title>Work</title>
	<lyrics>[Intro: Solomon Childs]
Yeah you know
Niggaz keep talkin' bout
Theodore this and Theodore that
Niggaz need to stop worryin' about the Theodore
Worry about your muthafuckin' self

[Chorus: Solomon Childs]
From the door you gotta put in that work
Rep your work move that work
Apply that work kill or get hurt
Eastside hear the adrenaline dirty

[Solomon Childs]
Money make the world go round
Here muthafuckas can't fuck with me pound for pound
We only got one life to live so I need a gangsta bitch
A ratchet with a big kick captain of my own ship
Cuz fake niggaz dream too much
And talk too much shit do it sound like I'm playin'
With you muthafuckas go 'head me squeeze like Smucker's
This ain't a gimmick for me to get on
Do an R&B remix with P. Diddy and R. Kelly
I don't know those muthafuckas
You see me in the club high poster
Never who that see me on the block with the roaster
Never who that see me in somethin' pretty and big with the chauffeur
Never who that model type tipsy on the side of the coaster
Uptowns white on white valor suits the color of _mocha
Upstate New York ran with the trademark the kid poker
I ain't talkin' bout a card game talkin' bout blood on your face frame

[Chorus]

[Solomon Childs]
You bitch ass niggaz you ass cheeks and it reeks
Like the smell of dead Mafia at the bottom of creeks
Mahonda speaks that the true Messiah is speaked
This the first year of the future walk with me little nigga
Order to my people people to my order
And pull myself together with the thought of a flat five
For manslaughter I'm prepared to lead nations
From Muslims to Bloods to Masons
Music to guide killas through out dreams
Of self destruction 20-05 eruption
Get the drop on who cousin? I believe in guns hustling
Blood in your mouth mumbling
Misinformation is the height of ignorance
That invites disaster and suffering
To blow a whole through the fader
Theodore Unit AKA the Al Qadea

[Chorus]

	<title>Loungin' Wit My Cru</title>
	<lyrics>Intro: Yogi
Aiyo tonight
Ain't no more bitches
Ain't no more hoes
No freaks no niggas
No gun sligin right about now
Tonight only yo we just gonna ride

Chorus 2X: Yogi

Loungin' wit my Cru uptown
With the drop town down with the funky sounds
Chillin with my peoples and tomorrow there's gonna be a sequel

{Yogi}(The Mighty Ha)
Aiyo I like it when the pools Mark B. representin
Beautiful ladies callin out cross pimpin
Blastin phone numbers baggin off to the other
Findin out later that's ya man baby mother
Sippin henecy everyone lookin jiggy
Buy a bag of smoke hydro get the fitty
Wanna roller skate ring style extra glide
Hit it to the bounce say ride (where we at?)
The Cru on the desert Mecca Medina
(Hum do love) Oh you never heard of Nina
Gotta a lotta things he end up doin baby
Nuff to make a nuh go crazy
Take a minute pause for a group flick
Cru and the Gucci don called Mark Pitts
And the whole fleet of uptowns
Harlem Nights Bronx Bombers and a bunch of four pounders
I like how it feels I like how it keeps it sureal for real
And yo how I like how I put shit together
(So what's your deal for?) Aiyo I'm down for whateva

Chorus 2X

{Chadeeo}(The Mighty Ha)
Back of my building the park green benches
Nails bein chewed by the white clean dentures
Shh No kid is him in the ears
Warm my lap a head with no hair
Beats freestylin but all we can talk
Rhymin with force till the jokes get corpsed
Tools on my waist and a frown on my face
Just in case the enemy tries to bring a base
The kid to be a waste after a taste
Of the hot lid which is mercury laced
In the neighborhood so far so good
Somebody gotta be up to no good
Shots fired on Watson Avenue
Where they won't hesitate shoot me stabbin you (True)
That's aight every night they be blowin
Keep their glock hot while we keep the cash flowin
It's another Cru that's two in the system
Thinkin of E and Squirrel how much is missed 'em
But I'mma stay sounded my peeps is around
Cuz of them I keeps my feet on solid ground

Chorus 4X

	<title>Protect Ya Neck (The Jump Off)</title>
	<lyrics>[INS]
Ladies and gentlemen we'd like to welcome to you
All the way from the slums of Shaolin
Special uninvited guests
Came in through the back door
Ladies and gentlemen it's them!

Dance with the mantis note the slim chances
Chant this anthem swing like Pete Sampras
Takin it straight to Big Man On Campus
Brandish your weapon or get dropped to the canvas
Scandalous made the metro panic
Cause static with or without the automatic
And while I'm at it yo you got cash pass it
It's drastic gotta send half to Dirty Bastard

[Raekwon]
Ayo ayo
Waves is spinnin blades is spinnin
Slay em in the eighth inning
Stay truck god stay playin linen
Kill rap observe the uptowns ho feel that
Mink jeans on seen where the real at
2000 zitos movin wit a ill ego
For real for real ill lines ill people
Yo bring it back 9 more civilians
Pollyin deals monopoly and bills
Y'all niggas lyin
Caught 300 lab look royal wit a mean stomach
Go broke all seen done it
Words from the heavy set
If I don't eat then we already met
Fly ass bro liver than coke

[Meth]
Now what Clan you know wit lines this ill?
Bust shots at Big Ben like we got time to kill
Niggas can't gel or I'm just too high to tell
Put on my gasoline boots and walk through hell
Wit 9 generals 9 ninjas in your video
9 milli blow semi auto wit no serial
Man metaphysical I speak for criminals
Who don't pay they bills on time and fuck wit digital
Never seen smoke a bag of evergreen
My sword got a jones more heads for the severing
Johnny in the dungeon takin all bets throw ya ones in
Scared money don't make money throw ya guns in

[Masta Killa]
That's word to Jah Mo San Juan Puerto Rico
Blowin hydro on a beach wit Tamiko
My gun bullet hollow for you to swallow
Blowin the nozzle hear it whistle
One in the head this is code red man for dead
X amount of lead spray from the barrel
Heat clear the street like Connor O'Carroll
Fully equipped rifles banana clip shit
To make my niggas from East New York flip

[Bobby Digital]
Yo you may catch me in a pair of Polo Skipperys matching cap
Razor blades in my gums (BOBBY!)
You may catch me in yellow Havana Joe's goose jumper
And my phaser off stun (BOBBY!)
Y'all might just catch me in the park playin chess studyin math
Signin 7 and a sun (BOBBY!)
But you won't catch me without the ratchet in the joint
Smoked out dead broke or off point (BOBBY!)

[Ghostface]
Wallo's comfortable chocolate frosting
Your socks hangin out yours is talkin
Rock so steadily son I'm still crazy
Sport my old Force MD furs in the 80's
Nat Turners wit burners Jackie Joyner-Kersee
Taught y'all niggas how to rap reimburse me
Rothsdale's ruby red sales Bloomingdale's blocks
Ox tails chopped up in Caribbean spots
I'm nice maxed out creepin wit the ax out
Murder these bikini bitches switchin with they backs out

[U-God]
Niggas wanna pop shit I pop clips
Bitch I'll put my dick on ya lips
Alabama split hammer slay quick
That David Banner gamma ray shit
Shells in the mouth jailhouse snitch
My powder voice Snow White stiff
Verbal killas gorilla grip
God body shit puff Marley spliffs

[Cappadonna]
You might see me in a 6 that's not my style
You might see me wit a bitch that's not my child
I be in the benzo keep a low profile
Dead serious take flicks and don't smile
Tryna get money y'all cats is wild
I pose for the clothes make a song like wild
I'm a chip off the board game got sword game
Live life to the fullest still want more fame
Darts on layaway beats on standby
Outfits pressed up ready for airtime

[GZA]
Run on the track like Jesse Owens
Broke the record flowin without any knowin
That my wordplay run the 400 meter relay
It's on once I grab the baton from the DJ
A athlete wit his iron cleat in the ground
Wildest nigga who sprint off the gun sound
The best time yet still 7.0
Swift flow made the cameramen clothes blow

	<title>I'm Tryin'</title>
	<lyrics>Verse One: B.G.

I'm tryin' to do right
But I'm surrounded by wrong
Avoid the all night flight
And still make it on my own
I'm tryin' be cool
Do what I gotta do
But playa haters all over
So I roll with my crew
I'm tryin' stay over
And just stay my ass in school
Ain't  many choices to choose
And this rap game I can't refuse
I wanna win don't want to be the one to loose
My pistol my only friend
Cause busters try to bring the blues
Leavin brains with no clues
Spin the ben in black clothes
They tryin' ta' take my only life
Leave my folks on the front row
Bury me in providence
Heavy weight that rose
They wanna steal the B.G.
Now tell me Alton
Ain't that cold
What can I do
Now what can I do to get out the game
What can I do
Now what can I do to make change
Every other day around my way niggas dyin'
Hours flyin I want to go straight boy I'm tryin'

-Chorus- (Juvenile)
I'm tryin' to shake the monkey off of me
Lord please let me go where I needs to be
Ball 'till I fall it's a poor family
Fo' sho' I know the future got a lot of stuff for me

Verse Two: B.G.

I'm tryin' to get my mail straight
Sell cd's and tapes
I don't want to be jail bait
Niggas want to kill me
And increase the hell rate
They almost got me
But I slip the spot it was too late
I wanna be a role model for my lil' brother
And buy a fifteen room manison for my mother
Settle down wit' a silent hoe
And drop a tight seed
So I can raise another uptown B.G.
Just like me
I'ma give 'em but I wish had a dad
He goin' be smart and bad nigga
Throwin' up a solga rag
This world is kurupted
The police is crooked
My boy was runnin with a ??? gun
His young life they took it
This ??? is rotten
Everyday it get's colder
They throwin' away the key
Sendin' the soldiers to angoula
My round slangin' that yola
With they hand on that iron
To keep my mind right
Beleive nigga I'm tryin'

-Chorus-

Verse Three: Lil' Wayne

I'm tryin' to be a man at fourteen
Choppin iron at fourteen'
Nigga that tells my only way
(B.G.: Look where you stand at fourteen)
A lil' bity something
Whuckin representin' partners
Ain't to good in my neighborhood
Uptowns my partner
I ain't lie i'm tryin
To go the right way
But the night flight way
Just ain't the right way
I wan' be a gangsta but also wan' live
So I choose to be a uptown HotBoy hard to kill
Sittin' behind the cruiser wheel
Can't even see me I'm so lil'
And you expect me to give this
Just to switch to positive
As hard as I'm tryin' do it I just can't make a shape
School I'm tryin' go through it but I just can't make a shape
Gettin' in beef that resultin' into serious gun slangin
Do good I want yeah but on half i just keep hangin'
I'm lookin for a change but change ain't lookin for me
Will I remain a B.G.
Or a A student
We'll see

-Chorus- 2x

	<lyrics>[Baby]
Now since my gear be on shine
These haters be packin' dey nine
But look playa I'm down for mine
Try'n to catch me at the red light gettin my shine
But I use my nina to protect me at all times
I just bought that new lexus that 1998
The bubble lights boy wit' them 19 inches
See I'ma talk about my Humvee at the end of my rhyme
I just bought that new Range Rover wit' them six new tires
Now every broad I know I done sexed at least one time
Now playboy tell me how you love that

[Mannie Fresh]
Last night i got a call on my phone
Ike Turner wanna make a "gangsta slap-a-broad" pimp song
He said "I called you man cause you the realest"
Lay it down lay it down cause these broads love Willis
Have "woes' that suck toes and wash clothes
Playas try to fit ya like a pair of Girbauds
Girls in the morn'n to brush my teeth
Lil' girls  wit curls love to wipe my feet
BLING diamonds glistenin' everywhere
It's allright for that girl look at me y'all let her stare
Baby I know I'm gorgeous cause I'm the largest
Jet skiis and M3's in my garag-es

[Chorus: PapaRue]
I bought a Hummer that's sittin' on 32's
We love stun'n and givin' these broads the blues
Fresh got a Burban that's sittin' on 20's fool
Woodgrain TV's and it's all cool (2x)

[Baby]
Now playa tell me how you can beat this
A million dollars worth of cars all on chrome can you defeat this
Wit all new homes 8 of 'em
The Hot Boy$ new album Guerilla Warfare and it jumped of strong
I spent 2 million buildin' my own home wit a million dollars worth of furniture
All on wood grain homie
See playa I ain't gotta stunt cause I can bag 'em up believe dis
Ask the police at Eastover has he seen this
Playa wit diamonds and gold across the T-O-P
And every broad in my passenger seat I done sexed fo' free
These broads I love to sex 'em til they see
That I aim to succeed to be a top rank in this industry
And my Humvee playboy I got so much wood in this vehicle
You gotta see it it should be a coffin seat
Wit four brand new TV's wit VCR
The Big Tymer$ new video gon' air on tomorrow
Ridin' on 32's and you can't miss these G's
All on chrome from the heart of the U.P.T.
When I get my big baller party
Playa I'ma let all these tenderonies drink for free Domm P.
And Cristal you know how we play it boy when we comin' through in that Humvee

[Chorus]

[PapaRue]
Shooney nooney nowny no shooney nooney nooney nowny no
Oh oh
Shooney nooney nowny no come down come down

[Lil Wayne]
Now we be Big Tymers wit the diamonds sparklin'
Some of uptowns finest we ballin'
I'm the smallest soldier in the click
but still ride bir ol' black on black trucks wit kits
See everybody get they shine on at 226
CMB flash ya wrist and let ya diamonds glisten remix
My boys poppin' champagne
Lil Wayne in the marrow wit the bubble frame
Uh-huh we the ones wit the stretch Hummer
A helicopter Benz Burban and a Lex bubble
I play the platinum Navigator when I ride
5 thousand dollar high sippin' Cristal
I got twenty on my finger look it's all gravy
They say it's all about Fresh and all about Baby
Big Tymers boy you know how we play
Worth about a hundred mill on a bad day
We love STUN'N

Can't buy this super fly in this
Like shininess you're highness
It's performin' look how long the line is
It's what happens when you make shit that's timeless
It's what happens each rapper's the pioneers
What would it take to be a legend like Nas is?
That's so novice I'm so polished
I got a right to be a 'lil snobbish
I did a 'lil bit of College
Semesters it took two like Rob Base
To let me figure out this was in my place
The beat's slow 'til you listen to my pace
'Cause I be killin' shit but that's evident

Perseverance..
See the fake hustler rapper
To them it hurts to hear this
Oh you went platinum? Yeah that's nice
Now let me see you do the same thing twice
Three times four times then a couple of mo' times
Please you're Amateur Night it's Showtime
It's one life to live so live it the best you can
The world could use one less man
Not enough air not enough car factories
To manufacture new vehicles sedans and vans
When they do make the whip you like your chips ain't right
By the time you could afford it the car ain't important
In the streets I'm in it's just iron
Cops keep firin' in my environment
Leavin' you slumped then they drive home
Far from the hood brothers they eager to jump on
I like to be the wall that they toast up on
I like to see them fall guilty for doin' wrong
I'm classic like the Air One's the hustler shoe
That's what I'm accustomed to.. yea

[KRS-One Sample]
"Of course - we have Blastmaster KRS-One"

[Verse Three: KRS-One]
How many of y'all got - 'Criminal Minded'?
You you you y'all don't be blinded
Me - I got no jewels on my neck
Why? - I don't need 'em I got your respect
KRS-One 20 years I rock
I do it for JMJ and Scott La Rock
This hip-hop and we is a nation
Don't you wanna hear more KRS-One on your radio station?
Instead of broadcasting how we smoke them trees
On the radio we need to hear more local emcees
Where you at? c'mon where you at?
This is the difference between emceein' and rap
Rappers spit rhymes that're mostly illegal
Emcees spit rhymes to uplift their people
Peace Love Unity havin' fun
These are the lyrics of KRS-One..

[Rakim Sample]
"I'm Rakim the fiend of a microphone.."

[Verse Four: Rakim]
Uh yea is y'all ready for 20-07?
It's now another drought
Everybody's a killer wow we buggin' out
Since '86 showin' the crowd what I'm about
And they still wanna know when the album comin' out
Askin' teenagers OG's and nasty kids
What their definition of Classic is?
Timeless so age don't count in the booth
When your flow stay submerge in the fountain of youth
Ain't no doubtin' the truth I'm off the meters
Everybody cosignin' even the non-believers
Since I came in the door and became one of y'all leaders
In a fresh pair Air Force sneakers
Uptowns we call 'em uppies when they're on divas
Probably worn when KRS-One raw teachings
Nas - Made You Look before the heaters
I bet Kan' had 'em on when he walked with Jesus

Can't buy this super fly in this
Like shininess you're highness
It's performin' look how long the line is
It's what happens when you make shit that's timeless
It's what happens each rapper's the pioneers
What would it take to be a legend like Nas is?
That's so novice I'm so polished
I got a right to be a 'lil snobbish
I did a 'lil bit of College
Semesters it took two like Rob Base
To let me figure out this was in my place
The beat's slow 'til you listen to my pace
'Cause I be killin' shit but that's evident
And y'all feelin' it but I expected it

	<title>Spittin' Game</title>
	<lyrics>Fresh. Slim Baby. Hot Boys. Hot Boys in this bitch. Check it out.

Turk:
Niggas steady getting chopped
Losin they life behind stupid shit
Ain't that a bitch
Niggas gettin' they wig split
And it's a shame
Killin' has became a fame
I cannot see my brains layin
On the ground
I keep my 9 on my waistline
Chop 'em down
Picks up the shells could leave no evidence around
and it's t-shirt land
when niggas ain't playin'
Got a chrome glock got it cocked
Red dot on yo' knot
As I pop
Nonstop
Till you drop
Pronounced dead
On the spot
It's a tragedy when I spin' yo fuckin' block
A nigga from BlackConnect
Will leave ya wet
Fa' sho yo' face is on the next
If ya disrespect
I ain't fakin' it yo' life I'm takin' it
Hollow points bullets racin' it
Niggas ain't makin' it
When I bust
Tell it to any nigga chopper bullets you can't trust
If you bust when I spray
Head for shelter
10% is gonna help ya 90 is gonna fail ya
A lot of punk niggas try to play hard
Put yo' face on a fresh tee sendin' that ass to the morgue
Better be cool if you don't that's all on you.

Bullet Proof:
16 worth a mill my whole clique push dope
Transportin' ki's in the all black Camero
50 G's on the seat layin' next to my heat
I'm a Hot Boy to the police
And I'm a thug on the street
Yeah I score from Slim and B
10 a ki real OG's 36 oz's formed the halves
Goin' for 2 G's
UPT connect bout stackin' leave ya wet
Niggas who disrespect my chopper put in check
Big body on broaders that's all I know
Mansion on Washetona 6 figures on the floor
Double R and DR watched by Uptown security guards
10 G's a ki 36 o's a piece
4 and a half 2 G's but I'll take 18
Got some niggas on my team bout head bussin' and green
Flippin' ????? G's hoopties to benzies
I get my ki's from my uncle KC
He's a Magnolia soldier
Be in 10 in Angola
Shoot out in that 'Nolia
Knock ya head off ya shoulders

Juvenile:
I ain't about no playin
When I'm comin' get out the way
Gun play bussin' a nigga ass on the runway
Head straight back to the hot block
Flight in a half
If I'm out there bad I might cut you in half
UTP tatooed it across my stomach stay booted
Look I'm a looter holdin' the Ruger
Or a 6 shooter
On Tuesdays and Thursdays
You better watch for the sweep
Look them people gon' act a ass if you get caught in the street
I'm layin off in some room by my bitch duckin' them people
Staked out the area and rob the chinese store
Do it like it's legal I heard heads in power
Bitches want the dope dick children and cop blockers
Niggas in the cut with ski masks lookin' for me
I'm on top of the roof with a chopper watchin' em too
Fuck with me your mans urge get in his curtains
Now send ya people
To the TC and we gon' hurt 'em
I'm seein' niggas
Shootin like that heavy on 'bauds and tens
I'm in the Chevy with B.G. and our girlfriends
Park 'round the corner leave ya gun and creep slow
Look bitch this ain't the night show lay it down hoe
Ya think I'm playin ask Baby and Slim how I can
Hook me up I don't have time for no games
Look here I stompin in this bitch
I'm chompin' a new fit
I'm bound to snatch a hoe and make her monkey on this dick
Look at what ya facin partner
A whole nation
Of niggas that's mind damaged
????? paper chasin'
With that iron I'ma roll wit em
Mama don't pray for me I don't back down from no nigga
They got a place for me

Lil Wayne:
See I want millions hundreds and big thousands
Tryin' to rain clout and third ward public housin'
Uptown streets is where all my ends meet
Give me 9 9 G tryin' to see my destiny
I do it all to ball drop the phone if I call
See I'm livin' real large eventhough I'm real small
But don't let that fool ya
Money rules everything around me
Creepin up silent behind ya that's where ya find me
I ain't hear for a lil
I want the whole damn spot
I cock my glock and have ya plot so I turn out to the top
Nigga be runnin' with money
Things you doin' I done done it
9 9 point 5 mil big deals keep it comin
Slugs hummin' chopper gunning catch the vapor from the laser
Infrared fled big bread money maker
Pop a slug barrell shaker for big paper
Big ballin' life taker for big caker
Ben Franklin bank televancin' big bankin
Bust 'em ???? em left stankin' ship sankin'
Ain't no such thing like see another nigga come up
But if I don't know that other nigga then his come up is my stuff
Call it a bluff if you want but come and test for ya own
See how quick model homes leave home and ????
Roam to the top slip up and get buck
Get out my way fo' I spray
I'm tryin' to live up

B.G.:
Young thugger baby gangsta
Thug or get popped
Off top
Aim my pistol straight for head shots
I release the safety if ya chase me
Best waste me
Don't hunt bitch down in ya way
Or ya make me
Reverse the game and wax that ass
Stop you from playin'
I clear yo block on that ass
Nigga wonder why I stress
Uptowns the place
It's the best
We got weapons that'll go through ya vest
Get left wet
Disrespect it's beef fo sho
Got back up from the Mac Melph Calio
You got coke and don't wanna go broke
VL it
Cuz around me bitch I'm doin bad ya can't sell it
B.G. terrorize
4 niggas ya dig
Bitch niggas get split
If you got change on ya wig
I'll take the hit
Real fast and quick
226 my clique Cash Money the shit
Project heroes
Bout 6 zeroes
Makin' records is the front we got 10 kilos
Unload reload
If ya ball you fall
If I jack you I don't want half I want all
Stand tall for mine
Nuts hang I'm real
My skills outstandin'
Kill or be killed
Niggas out to give me the blues
Let 'em kill me I refuse
I'm down for killing
But the one of <edited> I was accused
I leave ya funky
I put my trunk-y
Hair by a monkey
So what ya self cuz I'm down to act a donkey
In the  N.O. town jackers 3 4 deep
Put ya sleep if ya playin' wit a QB
Bitch
