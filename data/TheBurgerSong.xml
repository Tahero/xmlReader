A chicken oriental with salad on the side

      Friends

     <lyrics>
      Do you know where you goin to?
Do you like the things Warren G has showed you... you
Do you know where you goin to?
Do you like the things Warren G has showed you...you

G and Snoop, homeys from the jump and the get go
devoted and quoted back in 84
growin up in the LBC
platinum city, where the big gamers be
involved in everythang from Pop Warner
to whats poppin on every corner
find a skirt if you wanna
tryin to come up in this world
where everything is drama
Beverly was like my mama
W-A-double R-E-N
tryin to get in where I can fit in
catchin a bus with a homey I can trust
3 homeys from the hood straight kickin up dust
enjoyin my days and everythang is fine
15 years old Snoop d whoop on the grind
tryin to find ways to make it, dice shake it
young, havin fun, like me Snoop and Nate did

Chorus
We be havin fun, no one could do the things that we do
We be havin fun, no one could do the things that we do

I remember all the scams we been through, together
nobody does it better on which you do the weather
the days we used to call first year playin get like me
gettin in fo of zines, I loved em
Long Beach was the hometown
and every spot that we rocked, you know we got down
outside at the club just spittin raps
and every busta that ran up was gettin cracked
underground tapes used to be the claim to fame
Long Beach Was A Mutha was a classic mane
tellin tales about how we was strugglin
and surrounded wit tha homeys that was all clubbin
tryin to make it in this music
quick fast, quick cash, and hittin on the quick dash
we in this game to make hits
and make everybody respect the G-Funk click

Chorus
We be havin fun, no one could do the things that we do
We be havin fun, no one could do the things that we do

We went from young G's
to sellin million overseas
rollin Dees
and makin money by the trees
to killer Bees, evading all enemies
catastrophies, young GFC's
we made it now, livin good wit no hassles
but still a lot of problems dealin wit shady acts doe
its all a part of makin hits doe
see our careers take off like a US missle
break out the crystal
I spitted it, and now its g funked out, transmitted it
so you can call it what you want
we still goin bring the funk
G's up put it down, and ya weed to float

Chorus x3

      (Extra Kool)
(Let me get a boca burger with extra bacon)

(Extra Kool)
Being straight edge aint easy but its fun for the girls
We feed them rufies and downers just to watch their heads swirl
(Time)
Sometimes we get a kiss on the cheek but nothing that leaves our lips moist
And the not having sex part isnt by choice

Now I wouldn't go that far to tattoo x's on my hands
But this permanent markers fading and that thing spinning is my only fan
I dont want a sip peer pressures for high schoolers
Im not thirsty not even for a wine cooler
Had to deal with reality since my alveoli sacks filled
Stressed out both my eyes feeling cracked out and swelled
But I still see things I and obey if they ask me to follow
Passed out like a transient hugging a Zima bottle
I smoke with my second hand using neither my left or my right
(Yo dont even ask me for a light)
Things get intense, when i ignite a nag champa and get shitfaced from the incense
(Yo is this guy sober)
Im positive like my breathalyzer
Running red lights and octagons and Im your designated driver

(Kool)
smile for me please you make me wanna taste your suicide
just an ugly set of teeth, little boy sad with an epileptic lifestyle

(Time)
Been engaged for a while now my wife's denial
Were planning on having kids Im gonna name him Justin Love
Just in case I have to pull this plug and unscrew my smile from their face

(Kool)
Im tired of being mommies little monster the black sheep
Hopelessly straight edge and no one knows these limbs are too damn cheap
Gods a sheep and I think it's time we dodge these lullabies
Hands on heads the holes are centered,
And now's the time for everything to die, must I try?
But her bruises are just so damn tasty
I only want her hands in my heart, so why does she hate me?
I only took advantage when her legs fell off
I celebrated with a Curly shuffle
And a stomach full of rocks. I am Jack's colon, I get cancer and kill Jack.
Well that about sums it up, it use to be the handcuffs
But what about the bullets in the back?

(Extra Kool)
Being straight edge aint easy but its fun for the girls
We feed them rufies and downers just to watch their heads swirl
(Time)
Sometimes we get a kiss on the cheek but nothing that leaves our lips moist
And the not having sex part isnt by choice

(Kool)
The enemy is Syphilis, it's just a Grimy contribution
Time is the amphetamine, smiles as the head gently starts to loosen
Mr. Crispy Extra Kool, the silent half of Optik Fusion
Pardon me, but I'm pretty sure my head has already abandoned my body
Its go time, and these groggy frames are starting to make me feel naughty
Like here kitty, kitty, if only you'd let me in, please?
I'm just a broken heart sparked, the one who loves to watch the knees bleed
Feed me huh! because I'm getting a little anxious
(Youre just not fun any more)
Thats just because these veins show no traces goodness
Gracious, how could I let the cigarette burns spark my interest?
The straighter the edge the more the wall paper turns
These works are a product of deep breaths
Intense yes, but that's just the way the cookie crumbles
Oh how silly of me please come and tempt death
Wont you come and taste my disease
These words are killing me softly
So there's no time to watch me crumble
I don't want to play connect the dots with the track marks
And this addiction is already causing me enough trouble
And now it's time to let the angel out of the closet
Because I'm tired of him taunting me
The cat is out of the bag, so now it's time to kill the little kitty
So no matter what the addiction I'll always remain faithful
These are my favorite horns spewed from a grimy tongue spoken through fables

(Time)
8 glasses a day whether its tap water or river
8 packs a day whether its for your lungs or liver
Skipping through alleys, talking to myself sober as hell
Following track marks for miles, skiing down noses
Cause it's up to the government if drugs are in style
Put nicotine in my gum and liquor stores on my corner
In the couch potatoes inject dumb and call the coroner
The television hides the drink, while the billboards advertise national disorder

(Time and Kool)
We dont smoke but the pollution'll probably give us emphysema
Ah fuck it let's go attack and tap that keg of Zima

      [Thes One]
I might call your spot pumpin' if you got crushed ice
In a styrofoam cup with the refill rights
So homie no time to chill we got places to try
I gotta find some grilled onions and a large side of fries
Some guys are mad smart, some guys are tough dudes
But me and my homies we mostly care about food
Got spots to peruse and never choosin' McDonald's
I'm talkin Al's cheesteaks, Dino's and Chano's
Tomy's on Pico, Hi-Life in Pasadena
Man and Lucky Boy too and I can't forget Arena
Wilson Burger by PCH in Hawthorne
And right around the corner is Y-Not, it's awesome
Melrose got Astro's and that's that
I only mess with Fat Burger if your fries are fat
Now Whittier you got Ruby's they're renowned for their shakes
It's like the Claim Jumper pilin up the food on your plate
Wait, now better yet let me tell you 'bout that Busy Bee
You get the Belly Busterthe chicken or the pastrami
Tommy's on the late night, Eat Well for breakfast
And Fritto Misto with my ladygnocchi's the best dish
Shout to Papadakis, Lighthouse and a Waffle House
Fantastic Cafe and Pronto they rule the South
Word to your mouth until the next Phillippe's
Yo I'm out on the streets looking for something to eat

[Double K]
When I'm chillin' I'd rather be grillin
Gimme a plate of the flavor and Mike starts stealin'
Now if I ain't squeezin lemon on the roast chicken
I'm jumpin on the row like the fast food villain
Burgers I be killin, tomatoes and all
I be coolin in the food court of your favorite mall
Buyin' brunch like it was weight, throw it in the back of the trunk
I'm off to Tom's #2 to get me some lunch
Ten beef tacos, señor. Extra cheese.
And the chips that you got at the store, lookie here
Now I just passed Oki-Dog, I'm headed toward Lucy's
Passed the Roscoe'sthey can keep them waffles
In the distance I see a place they call El Rey
Home of the garbage burrito and if not then hit Benito's
Taquitos for days and a big bag of Lay's
Wash it down with a soft drink, hmm, let me think
I head down west to the A-1 Burger
Where the french fries are fresh and you might get murdered
Or what about Johnny's pastramis and shakes
So you can hit Chabelita's for the midnight break
After the club spend a dub and you can feed your crew
On any given day this is what I might do
Go place a order, then wait, pick it up

      WRMS' Dedication to the Bitty
     </title>
     <lyrics>
      SQUIRREL: We've just played fifteen minutes of commercial free music.
Of course you're listening to WRMS FM, and we
play nothing but De La Slow music. We're coming up on the hour of ten
o'clock. It's a full moon, and perfect night
for lovers. We're about to do something we don't usually do, and
that's... we'll I'll show you.

BITTY: Hello, hello, who's this?

SQUIRREL: Squirrel.

BITTY: Hi! Listen, I don't have a lot of time, my name's Mizuna, I'm
on my dinner break from Burger King and I just
called to tell you that I love your new radio station, I love
everything you guys do.

SQUIRREL: Thank you. And with that, the next song is just
for you. And when you go back tell all the Burger King
honeys that if they want to call and talk to me, just call
WRMS. See ya.

      Promentalshitbackwashpsychosis Enema Squad (The Doodoo Chasers)
     </title>
     <lyrics>
      [Verse One: George Clinton]
The world is a toll-free toilet
Our mouths neurological assholes
And psychologically speaking
Is we're in a state of mental diarrhea
Talking shit a mile a minute
Or in a state of constipated notions
Can't think of nothing but shit
And this is world of stinky futures
Between shitty memories, and constipated 19 now-nows
Emerges from the hiney of your head
The doo doo chasers
The Promentalshitbackwashpsychosisenemasquad
The prune juice of the mind
The doo doo chasers, friends of roto-rooter
Bringing you music to get your shit together by;
The band in the tidy bowl of your brain

[Hook: Linda Brown]
What was that long word again-Promental?
The Promentalshitbackwashpsychosis Enema Squad

[Interlude: George Clinton]
A musical bowel movement
Designed to rid you of moral diarrhea
Social bullshit, crazy do-loops, and mental poots
They call us the unflushables, one swipe a clean wipe

[Hook: Linda Brown]
Go flush it, fellows!

[Verse Two: George Clinton]
And what causes all of this shit?
What is the source of food for thought?
Ego-munchies, images doggie bags
My burger with hot sauce on it
Me burger with hot sauce on it
A myself sandwich, a personal burger, hamburger
And a glass of constricted Cola
Out to lunch with lunch meat
The fear of being eaten by a sandwich
The Promentalshitbackwashpsychosis Enema Squad
The doo doo chasers, friends of roto-rooter
Music to clean your shit by; an Enema Squad

[Hook: Linda Brown]
Also wanted to hear..

[Verse Three: George Clinton]
Low calorie logic, muscle brains, skinny brains
Count the calories of your thoughts
Funk, Confucius says, like Chinese laxatives
Sweet and sour bowel movements
And in this world of stinking memories
Stinking memories, and shitty futures
19 now nows-constipated-like, versions the doo doo chasers
The prune juice of the mind
The band in the tidy bowl of your brain
Bringing you music to clean your shit by

[Hook: Linda Brown]
Hummmm.. Hummm.. Humm...

[Verse Four: George Clinton]
Funk; the P-Preparation, the prune juice of the mind
The mental musical bowel movement
Groovalax, one swipe a clean wipe
And with no extra charge
A psychological trend mover, a neurological enema
Holy Shit (let me try one-crap)
Corpolite, prehistoric doo doo
Helping you get your shit together
Backstage at a Funkadelic rehearsal
We bring you the doo doo chasers (Which one is George Clinton?)
Out to lunch with lunch meat, once again
The fear of being eaten by a sandwich
Lunchville, where lunch is a nice time of day at least twice a week

[Outro: George Clinton]
The Fried Ice Cream is a reality, fried Ice Cream is a reality!
The Fried Ice Cream is a reality, fried Ice Cream is a reality!
The Fried Ice Cream is a reality, fried Ice Cream is a reality!
(Which one is George Clinton?)
Guess who's coming to lunch
I'm not gonna pay for this lunch, man!
The Fried Ice Cream is a reality, fried Ice Cream is a reality!
The Fried Ice Cream is a reality, fried Ice Cream is a reality!
The Fried Ice Cream is a reality, fried Ice Cream is a reality!

      (Humpty Hump)
Yo Num, open up, hurry up, Humpty Hump mane
Unlock the door mane
I think she's dead, I left her on the floor mane

(Numskull)
I'm comin' nigga, damn, you too loud, shut the fuck up
I got neighbors nigga

(Humpty Hump)
Fuck that!  You gotta save a nigga!

(Numskull)
What?  The fat thing I gave you?
Where the fuck you take it?

(Humpty Hump)
That's what I'm sayin'!  Let me in!  She ain't make it!

(Numskull)
Dude, I thought you took her home?

(Humpty Hump)
Uh-uh, that bitch is gone

(Numskull)
WHAT????!!!!!

(Humpty Hump)
Aight, we stopped at Burger King on the way home
Both of us get high, while we was waitin' on the food
Yo, you won't believe this Dude
I took her in the bathroom, did my thug thing in her mouth
Then she went limp and passed the fuck out!!!!!

(Numskull)
I'm down, let's go get her and bring her here

(Humpty Hump)
But she had no pulse, her heartbeat I couldn't hear

(Numskull)
What the fuck you mean no heartbeat and no pulse????!!!!

(Humpty Hump)
She's DEAD nigga!  That's why the fuck I got GHOST
I noticed somethin' though
She was on somethin' yo
What you gave her?

(Numskull)
She came over with some high-ass behavior!

(Humpty Hump)
Well I'm bout to go and get her
My D-N-A up in her
I would ask you to go, but fuck it you know, you ain't hit her

(Numskull)
What you gone do with her?

(Humpty Hump)
I'ma dump her in the river

(Numskull)
What?

(Humpty Hump)
Uh, uh, uh, I don't know what to do, I'm stank

(Numskull)
I'm goin' too, you can't just take the case by yourself

(Humpty Hump)
You fucked?

(Numskull)
I wanted to help her with her health!
I gave her Vitamin C, D, E, and F too
Throat was so laced, she couldn't have even caught the flu
But she really wanted you, when I got her from Clee
I just did what I had to do and got a quickie

(Humpty Hump)
A fuckin' quickie?
You in it with me
And if you got her from Clee
That hoe is probably full of Hen and ecstacy
And if I know Clee, that's D-N-A sample number three
The only way we'll know what's up, we gotta get Clee

Chorus (all):

Can't be leavin' D-N-A,  No way!
We gotta carry her and bury her
There can't be nothin' scarier
Then we get the fuck outta town, on the next United Shuttle
Aight, who got the shovels?

(Humpty Hump)
Which way?

(Numskull)
You know where Clee live
Right there, knock on the door

(Humpty Hump)
Shiiiiiiiiit

(Numskull)
Ay Clee, we in some shit, what you do to this chick?
She dropped dead on Hump, nigga where you bump this bitch?

(Clee)
Man I ain't bump this bitch, a friend of mine knew her
THE FUCK YOU MEAN SHE DEAD?  WHAT Y'ALL DO TO HER????

(Humpty Hump)
All I did was tickle her

(Clee)
Nigga put that on your pimp coat!

(Humpty Hump)
Well my dick did the ticklin' in the back of her throat

(Numskull)
Ay come on, let's go get the shovels man we gotta move fast!

(Humpty Hump)
My nut's still in her stomach

(Numskull)
Me, uterus

(Clee)
Me, ass

(Humpty Hump + Numskull simulataneously)
You what?  I ain't know you fucked???!!!!

(Clee)
Ssssssssssssshhhhhh!!!!!!!  Would y'all shut the fuck up???!!!
Gotta figure this shit out, come on we need a plan
I got some shelves in the basement, y'all gimme a hand
Now where this fat bitch at?

(Humpty Hump)
Burger King

(Clee)
What you mean?

(Humpty Hump)
You know....Burger King

(Numskull)
Stupid!
This what I'm thinkin' about, the scene already boilin'
He left the bitch on the Burger King toilet spoilin'

(Clee)
Somebody must've found her, that was hours ago

(Humpty Hump)
No, I closed the stall door and put her feet on the floor
But hold on, now how we supposed to get her to the car?

(Clee)
I bought three duffle bags, an axe, and a hacksaw

(Numskull)
Aight we here, Hump, you killed her, so you chop her

(Humpty Hump)

     <lyrics>
      [Essman]
Kill-at-Will, welcome home boy

[Killa Will]
I work a bitch like a Hebrew
I'm tryin to ball like Ivo, but I don't fight over hoes like he do
I fight over dough and O's and diesel
Get found face down full of holes that's lethal
You people wouldn't blast a burner
Them niggaz is softer, than a wet White Castle burger
If you talkin 'bout gats it's murder, you get put in a coffin
Bullet sweat like half your shirt up
I show you niggaz how to dumb out
Smack you with the gat
Make you pull your tongue out, and put the blunt out
Stunt out on hoes, foes and haters
Killa known for gettin dough, b-bos and gators
Catch you later on that payroll (what?)
Shit I'm tryin to get mills
Rims and wheels, lookin like a stagecoach
Catch me cookin like I made dough
I get scrill for real, while y'all lookin like a staple

      The New Style
     </title>
     <lyrics>
      And on the cool check in
Center stage on the mic
And we're puttin' it on wax
It's the new style

Four and three and two and one (What up!)
And when I'm on the mic - the suckers run (Word!)
Down with Adrock and Mike D. and you ain't
And I got more juice than Picasso got paint
Got rhymes that are rough and rhymes that are slick
I'm not surprised you're on my dick
B-E-A-S-T-I-E, what up Mike D.
Ah yeah, that's me
I got franks and pork and beans
Always bust the new routines
I get it - I got it, I know it's good
The rhymes I write - you wish you would I'm never in training - my voice is
not straining
People always biting and I'm sick of complaining
So I went into the locker room during classes
Bust into your locker and I smashed your glasses
You're from Secausus - I'm from Manhattan
You're jealous of me because your girlfriend is cattin'

(bridge) There it is - kick it!!!

Father to many - married to none
And in case you're unaware I carry a gun
Stepped into the party - the place was over packed
Saw the kid that dissed my homey and shot him in the back
I had to get a beeper 'cause my phone is tapped
You better keep your mouth shut 'cause I'm fully strapped
I got money in the bank - I can still get high
That's why your girlfriend thinks that I'm so fly
I've got money and juice - twin sisters in my bed
Their father had envy so I shot him in the head
If I played guitar I'd be Jimmy Page
The girlie's I like are underage (Check it!)
Girls with boyfriends are the kind I like
I'll steal your honey like I stole your bike
Your father - he's jealous 'cause I'm making that green
I've got the girlie's numbers from the places I been

(repeat bridge)

You wanna know why - because I'm
October 31st - that is my date of birth
I got to the party and I did the Smurf
Taxing all females from coast to coast
And when I get my fill I'm chilly most
We rag-tag girlies back at the hotel
And then we all switch places when I ring the bell
I chill at White Castle 'cause it's the best
But I'm fly at Fat Burger when I way out west
K-I-N-G-A-D whammy
All the fly ladies are on my jammy
Went to the prom - wore the fly blue rental
Got six girlies in my Lincoln Continental
Met this girl at the party and she started to flirt
I told her some rhymes and she pulled up her skirt
Spent some bank - I got a high powered jumbo
Rolled up a wooly and I watched Colombo

Let me clear my throat - Kick it over here baby pop
And let all the fly skimmies, feel the beat...drop

Coolin' on the corner on a hot summer day
Just me, my posse and M.C.A.
A lot of beer - a lot of girls - and a lot of cursing
Twenty-two automatic on my person
Got my hand in my pocket and my finger's on the trigger
My posse's gettin' big - and my posse's gettin' bigger
Some voices got treble - some voices got bass
We got the kind of voices that are in your face
Like the bun to the burger - like the burger to the bun
Like the cherry to the apple - to the peach to the plum
I'm the king of the Ave. - and I'm the king of the block
I'm M.C.A. - and I'm the King Adrock
I'm Mike D. - I got all the fly juice
On the checkin' at the party on the forty deuce
Walking down the block with the fresh fly threads
Beastie Boys fly the biggest heads

      I Want it All
     </title>
     <lyrics>
      [Chorus]
I want it all
I want the cars and the fancy things
I want the life this success shit bring
I want the love and the power and respect
That's the way it seems
Said I said I want it all-ah-ah-all-ah-oh-all, ah-ah-oh
I said I want it all-ah-ah-all-ah-ah-all, oh-oh oh-oh-oh

[Saigon]
Okay; I wanna ball like LeBron or Chris Paul
But what I want even more is to finally get in the door
I want the critics to give me the credit that I deserve
Wanna show 'em how vicious a nigga is with the verve
Want the Burger King burger with the McDonald's fries
Want the Marriott but wanna save money so it's the Econo Lodge
I want people to see that I was poppin way before Entourage
Flow you can not describe
I wanna know if my sister fuckin if she protected
I want that President Obama to get re-elected
I want the kind of rhymin I'm doing to be accepted
Since my rhyme was silent at times I'd probably be rejected
I want... longevity
I want Saigon to be strong as I'll ever be, when I'm going on 70
I want mom's recipe for sweet potato pie
It was to die for, I want a reply y'all

[Chorus] w/ minor variations

[Saigon]
(I want it all) I want the Beamer, Benz and Bentley
Even though that I know they come with jealousy and envy
I want people to be honest even when it offends me
Unless they wanna wake up the violence that's deep within me
I wanna thank everybody that want the dark to shine
I wanna earn the true dollar sign without doin blue-collar crime
I want you and you to learn how to rhyme
You can't call yourself an emcee if you're just spewin the five'n'dime
I want the kids in the ghetto to go to school
by the multitude; want them to know that flunkin is so uncool
I wanna know who's relatin gangbangin with entertainment
Probably the same dude that'll be the complaintant
I want the paintings, y'all could buy up the jewelery
I want hip hop to stop providing this buffoonery
I want the opportunity, I promise on mommas I won't stall
I'm telling you pah~!

[Chorus] w/ minor variations

[Saigon]
(I want it all) I want to send a rest in peace to Mr. Mass Appeal
I wanna feel if Nicki Minaj ass is real
I wanna know if you dangerous or a daffodil
Like do you want this machete or want this Massengil?
I wanna welcome myself back into rap
Y'all can clap or have an asthma attack
As a matter of fact, I want everybody imaginin that
I was the one out of the pack that ain't go staggerin back
(Say it again) I wanna welcome myself back into rap
Y'all can clap or have an asthma attack
As a matter of fact, you think I came this far
for me to motherfuckin fall? Hell naw!

      Stunts
     </title>
     <lyrics>
      [ VERSE 1 ]
Yo check it, there's a girl around my way
Don't ask for names, cause I won't say
She's a real pow-wow who likes to play
Nah, dukes, her name ain't Fay
This girl couldn't be 19 or more
Always waggin her tail and on all fours
Real big hips with legs so healty
I asked her who's her man, but she won't tell me
Every now and then she might spend
Sometime with another female's boyfriend
Why? I don't know, maybe for fun
If you got the burger, she got the buns
Who you do with it, is your own thing
One time she nominated me the Burger King
I think of it now, even as I rhyme
We all determined she's a real good time

But a stunt
Is just like a blunt
Burnt
And a hoe
Yo dukes, they burn you slow

[ VERSE 2 ]
A pair of tight pants is all it takes
And the next thing you know, old Jimmy's awake
Believe that, Jimmy has to get loose
I recommended her to be my personal masseuse
She's a real fly girl if you get to know that
Take her to a party, watch her throw that
Party into gear, like she was a jeep
Four-wheel drivin into the sheets

Stunts
Are just like blunts
Burnt
And a hoe
Word dukes, they burn you slow

[ VERSE 3 ]
The more you listen, the better it gets
I still haven't mentioned the girl's name yet
Anyway I continue, I do intend to
Say a little more, not to offend you
Baby, maybe you enjoy the diss
Tell me, love, do you remember this?
One Monday night it was me and the gees
On the avenue puffin the sensi
Hasheem and Foundation was on the phone
I broke out to see if you were home
Got to your house, went around the back
You had on a night gown with nothin underneath that
Took me in your room, hung up my coat
Asked me if I wanna play _Love Boat_
"Yeah, how do you play it, remember?", I said
Then you pushed me into your waterbed
Raised my sail, squabbed the deck
Came up and put a hickey on the side of her neck
Worked me over and got undressed
Sent me home and said I needed to rest
I went on the ave., weak as a mouse
Build wasn't out there, he was at your house
Stayed for an hour, then he left
Shabazz went in, Melquan went next
Hour by hour, minute by minute
I wonder if you cleaned it before we got in it
A few days later I said wait a minute
I saw all the Gods sittin in the health clinic

Stunts
Are just like blunts
Burnin
And the hoes
Word em up, they burnin slow

Check it out:

[ Doctor ]
I have some good news and some bad news for you guys
The bad news is: you guys are all dripping
But the good news is: I have these penicillin shots for you]

[ VERSE 4 ]
There you have it, see what I mean?
Served my justice by a big butt in jeans
Now I know the actual truth
Never again will I mess with -
If you can rhyme, fill in the name
Don't get upset, just play the game
Remember her bark is worse than her bite
I wonder who the girl is with tonight
Maybe a drug seller, a crackhead, drunk
And he's nothin but a donut ready to dunk
She's nothin more than a female hound
Doin 3 to 6 years in the dog pound

But stunts
Yo dukes, just like blunts
Burnin
And the hoes
Word em up, they burnin slow

I hope my girl ain't checkin this out, man
I'd be in crazy trouble
But yo, I'ma get with y'all brothers later, man
Gotta go take this dosage, man
Peace

     <lyrics>
      (*talking*)
G'eah know I'm saying, it's going down right now
We got three legends in here
And we'd like to welcome everybody, to the South
Know I'm tal'n bout, so we gon take you on a lil' tour
And show you how we do it, where we come from
Know I'm saying, or like we say know I'm tal'n bout
(already, know I'm saying hey it's Koopa uh)

[Chamillionaire]
Stay froze up with the bluest wrist, stay coming through in the newest whip
Stay iced out like a new refrig-erator, say I do it big
Cause they know I do and they know it's true, and you mad when nobody don't notice you
Cause we rolling through and they know it too, Chamilitary it's Chamilitary known to do
What they can't million dollar crib, multi-million dollar deal
Multi-colored diamond grill, it's my multi-million dollar year
I'm for real I'm for real, it's the truth of the streets really trying to feel
Behind the wheel grinding still, cause I'm trying to feel on a diamond wheel
Swang the swangas with the swang and banga, in Suburbans and drops
When we pop up, niggaz know what time it is like the Burger King watch
If they don't then they can get beef, like it's a Burger King stop
Make an order get your recorder, while I murder it pop
I got my hand on my phone, they say it don't look like my phone
Police trying to catch me riding dirty, that's my clip and my chrome uh
Give me back my weapon you wise guy, stop hating cause the way a nigga ride fly
Turn all the speakers up in the fly ride, have a nigga block sounding like a drive by

[Hook]
If you wanna ride with us, you gotta be down to bust
If you wanna ride with us, talking to my G's and hustlers
If you wanna ride with us, 24's up on the truck
If you wanna ride with us, let me see ya throw your side up

[E.S.G.]
Ride with us or come roll with me, E.S.G. and my dog Bun B
And the C-H-A-M-I double L-I-O-N-A to the I-R-E
Me and Pimp C in a Bentley mayn, million sold independent mayn
Told you boys you ain't eat like us, trunk'll pop but u ain't beat like us
O.G. out the S.U.C., 0-7 ESV
R.I.P. to my dog Todd Profit, DJ Screw and P-A-T
ATL gon trap with it, rock and finger snap with it
H-Town slow it down, chop and double tap with it
Louisiana pop jiggas with it, diamond grill and get triller with it
Sipping lean with the championship team, watch me Pittsburgh Stealer with it
Fish scale like a real O.G., too many e-mails for me to read
www.myspace.com, forward slash yup E.S.G
Independent I'm a giant, backhand boys who act defiant
36 OZ wave my wand, go fade the one like Kobe Bryant
Never seen purple smoke this strong, big old spokes'll poke out on chrome
Leave it alone or get chrome to the dome, represent for your home if you know this song

[Hook]

[Bun B]
I got the keys in the ignition, the dro up in the gaurd
Candy dripping off my swisher shoes, cup in my car
I'm a ghetto superstar, I can cut any corner
Get to flipping and flossing, through any hood that I wanna
Bun B back up in the slab, navigating the town
Chunking deuces and showing love, when I'm coming around
I don't have to wanna try to be down, I been a G with it
All the game need, is Bun B and Pimp C in it
Underground King, P.A.T. that's where I'm from
Representing, until they send me back to kingdom come
Hustlers they want my downfall, short stoppers want my cuts
Rappers wanna take my spot, but they can all just get my nuts
Fingers up haters down, free the Pimp that's the drill
Lady shining on the grill, that's how we keep it trill
Diamonds up against the wood, pistol on my side
Banging Screw that's how we do in Texas, that's how we ride

     <lyrics>
      * send corrections to the typist

[Jamie Madrox]
Yo Fritz, put on a motherfucking beat
That we can shake our motherfucking rolls to
Yo, fat kidz are ya with me?
Put your motherfucking hands high in the air, let me see your little chubby digits
It's about to get sweaty in here ya'll, you might want to bring a fan
It ain't easy, being about 250, when you're 15 years old
That's what real life's about

Hey yo, fat people are hard to kidnap
So if you're fat and you're all in this bitch, then grab your nutsack
Fat bitches, don't feel left out
Cause you can grab one of them skinny bitches, and knock her ass out
Chubby love, show a ninja some
Cause this fat motherfucker stay ready however they come
A hungry rapper, cannible lyricist
I got host of MC's like you inside my shit
Standing poolside with a t-shirt on
Unless I'm showering or fucking, my clothes stay on
I got double cheeseburgers chasing me in my sleep
And fine hoes checking me out but scared to speak
Off the chain, off the scale, I ain't watching no weight
I'm at the barbecue high ass hell fixing my plate
XX to the X-L, hit me 3 times
Come correct with my burger and fries, the king sized

"This song is dedicated to all the fat people world wide, dead or alive.
Biggie Smalls, The One Man Gang, Chubb Rock, Chris Farley, 8 Ball, John Candy
Big Pun, Bam Bam Bigalow, Fred Bearing, Kevin Smith, E-40, Matt Nips
King Kong Bundy, Fat Joe, Blaze Ya Dead Homie, Fat Albert
and the Fat Boys, and Grimace. Monoxide used to be fat."

      My Nigga, My Nature
     </title>
     <lyrics>
      First Verse (Tim Smooth):

I was brought up around repeat felons
Niggas who keep sellin' they dope
In your hood, no matter what the priest tell 'em
Reached eleven and then turned buck
Go to school and don't learn FUCK!
They only in there to earn bucks
And me, I'm that homie though, Mr. Romeo
Slick talkin' dicksman I'm hawkin' straight through a pony hoe
Over the years we become one
Cuz where I come from
Roll with the rollers or you get done young
One of our goals is never get caught short
All of us gettin' swole with hustles of some sort
My hustle is hoes, but my niggas are servin' fiends
Some of them murdering
None of them Burger Kings
Seems the dream of clean green done got ghost
I'm gonna rock a crowd while my niggas rock dope
And I hope, I never get smoked cuz of somebody  in my crew
But if I do, I do

Chorus (Apple &amp; Taco):

I...
Miss my niggas, them my niggas
I don't know why, but it be's that way

(2x)

Second Verse (Tim Smooth):

Lately I be so loaded, I don't go around my Mama
Mind my brother with brains who can't stay away from drama
Time and time again I go to God askin' him to watch me
Stop me from bein' so cold or take my soul if somebody pop me
I'm not lookin' for trouble, I'm lookin' for love
Only find it in spots where they be, cookin' the drugs
And puttin' the bud in the air like chain smokers
Cuz it maintain focus enough to bust range rovers
Came close to death more times than Bugs Bunny
Barely spun, but, done slung a ton of drug money
I was bummy, now I'm in the crib of lavishness
My FIST full of green, my jeans is full of parenting

Chorus

[One minute, thirty seconds of talking from a live phone call]

      Fly Ass Nigga
     </title>
     <lyrics>
      [Kool Keith]
Dark voice, space choice
T-Mobile text vexed and you think you're in a competitive mode
Who's the wussy they can't be fly droppin a verse with a dirty pussy
Diaper show off your designer chains fuckin up my cypher
Retarded ass rap slash diva
Run around with a fucked up weave attachment hoe handcuffer
I don't know why that stupid nigga like ya
Step back you fuckin werewolf out of London, before I bite you
BBQ rib hounder fuck it you splash out that quarter pounder
The official rappin music co-founder since Ralph Hooper
and his pops ran the Apollo with the United Negro Fund
The richest nigga in the world, y'all can't fuck with the franchise
Imagine your local bullshit burger spot goin against Ronald McDonald
Italy can't stop the three billion servings
I'ma make Brandy hoes move they porkchops

[Chorus: unknown guest rapper]
Be a fly ass niggaz
And runnin around the city lookin at you bitch-ass niggaz
Tryin to play high post, wit'cha little kitty-ass withers
Knahmsayin? ... Fly ass NIGGA~!

[Kool Keith]
Broke niggaz worryin about how fast you can rap
Spit at quick speed with techniques that's sharp
Complex comprehension I'd rather see some tits
Turn your computers off and get off that gay shit
MySpace, Clayface claymation nigga
E-mail message abusers shit fag energy users
Livin in a fucked up town so boring drink fo' kegs
before you talk about me with them ugly bitches teasin you in Hooters
Y'all get the critic booters, website looters
You fuckin raccooners, you can't stop the bass boomers

[unknown guest rapper]
It be the motherfuckin Commi$$ion to all you whack-ass rap niggaz
out here sellin that fake-ass rap music to you little fuckin kiddies
What the fuck is goin out here with that rap shit?
Y'all need to get smacked, knahmsayin????
Runnin around, with the big Commi$$ioner, ain't playin no games
Stomp all y'all out, in this rap game
Fly ass niggaz!

      A Message to the B.A.N.
     </title>
     <lyrics>
      1991 Grilled Cgeese goes on it's way to different cities
Rocking for the kiddies
To do shows for rows, no foes, dough in escrow
All the money went to goddamned Joe
For cleaning the bus, we cussed, caps were bust
On us, Joe should have adjust to the goddamn musk
We were the Christmas and Joe Damn was merry
And kids had nothing but jokes just like Perry
Every night at the show was a good night
Hot Dog and Ev in the morning had a food fight
Chicken all over, rice, ham, beverage, pastrami
Yo it was comedy -- The B.A.N.

Back on the bust take the musk to the next city
And snoring by Frank Nitty
I'ma tell you I was about to be outtie
Lucky for me that homeboy Kirk Gowdy
Brought his tapes so flexed cause we were vexed
And seeked salvation in Derek X
So thank you thank you and alladat
Played the hell out of the Nubians -- the shit was fat
So now we're in Lafayette, Louisiana
Bought a three eighty from some little Dan Tana
Ripped the show got the dough and gained some fans
The grill dusty message to the B.A.N.

On the whole tour Rob was a fiend
He had the ugliest girl I've ever seen
He was with her the whole time after the show
He turned the light on -- me and Jojo said YOOOOOO!
What is that?
Rob you're bugging G damn her grill is wack
Your grill ain't alladat but you can do better
My man even had phone calls and sent her letters
In at the Denny's on the corner no one seen us
On Pokey's burger -- everything on it -- even penis
But Kirk Pone went and told the man
1991 Grilled Cheese Tour -- a message to the B.A.N.

      The Bristol Hotel
     </title>
     <lyrics>
      Verse 1

I know a fat girl, she wears a orange skirt
You give her twenty dollars and you can do work
She'll take food stamps and a traveller's cheque
Because her hair and her face and her life's a wreck
She wears a bright blonde wig, some high heeled pumps
She's down in the dumps so she's sellin' her rump
She's a hot little momma and she works every day
If you wanna pay to play, here's where she stays
She's at the...

Chorus

(Bristol Hotel) Room 515
(The Bristol Hotel) Where that at? (Jamaica, Queens!)

Verse 2

I seen her standin' there, slutty as could be
Offering the putty for a itty-bitty fee
Every red light she'll come over to your ride
Or she's standin' in the doorway tellin' you to come inside
The Bristol Hotel, cos it ain't no thing
And her meat tastes better than Burger King
Japanese executives in three-piece suits
Glasses all foggy when they come in the place
The girlies in the Bristol, they're all in cahoots
He fell asleep and got robbed, and cold chumped his face at the...

Repeat chorus

Verse 3

Party people check the story cos the story is ill
It's the story of two men, one Harold, one Bill
They went inside the Bristol on a Saturday night
Harold was cool but Bill felt uptight
The girlies made attempts but Harold played it cool
"Never ever rush, that's the golden rule
I been comin' to the Bristol's ten years of my life
A-yo, what the hell? Yo, man that's my wife!"

(The...)

Repeat chorus

Verse 4

You see, a Bristol girl is a one of a kind
And if you know her good enough she won't make you stand on line
She'll let you inside, make you pay for the ride
Take off her pants and then it smells like somebody died
You say "What the heck", because you already paid
Not knowin' that the guy that went before you had AIDS
Bang bang boogie, she was so amusin'
Next week you're at the clinic gettin' blood transfusions
At the...

Repeat chorus

(The Bristol Hotel) (till fade)

[Chorus: Mac Dre]
Ford, Chev, whatever ya got
Don't mean shit, shit ain't hot
Lincoln, Caddy, whatever ya got
Push it man, don't be scared to squat

[Dre Dog]
Quick fast in a hurry
Squat bounce drop dirty
Cocaine white tiger white walls
HIt the freeway hard at night y'all
With the keys right there I'm ready to drive
Like a eagle at 12 I'm ready to fly
Pager going off, the cell phones ringin'
Al Green's playin' and I keep singin'
Jeans creased up with the beat up
Now I'm about to go pick this little freak up
Blow L's, make mail, ponytails
Had to compliment her on her fresh done nails
Varoom, motherfucker boom boom
A whole block of green lights, freak zoom zoom
Mario Andretti with Blowjob Betty
Pedal to the metal when your ridin' with the devil
Did just that at In-n-Out Burger
No pickles, no onions, no playin'
Check this out no delayin'
Did a donut right is what I'm sayin' SHIT
Police came, I was on the streets
Smokin' more weed, bumpin' more beats
Puttin' more words in the ear of this freak
Cadillac girl, somethin' I'ma keep, Seville?

[Chorus]

[Mac Dre]
Cam, lifters, ? shifters
Three fifty one make the old school swifter
Rap in the trunk, slap in the trunk
Fat four-four in my lap for the funk
Talkin' to a beezy on the phone but can't hear her
Turned down the bump, so I can hear clearer
I hear sirens get nearer
Red and blue lights in my rear view mirror
Pull over, nope nope
With a car full of smoke and trunk full of dope
I hit the gasser, go faster
All you hear is dual exhaust, flowmaster
On a chase, I take 'em, then I shake 'em
A real Cutthoat nigga ain't no fakin'
I shoot, ain't scared to scoot
And shake them one time on a hot pursuit

[Chorus]

     <lyrics>
      * used for corrections and missing lyrics

Yeah
Jam on it
(Yeah, yeah, we know, we know)
Huh
(Yeah, Goggles, you gonna rock it, right)
(You gonna do it down, right)
Ha-ha-ha-ha, yeah
(Hey, Cozmo, what's the name of this again)
(I forgot)
Jam on it
(Oh)
(Oh, Chilly B, get down, ho)
(Oh, oh, here comes Cozmo)
(Ho)
(We get to say wikki-wikki-wikki again)
Wikki-wikki-wikki-wikki
(Shut up)
Wikki-wikki-wikki-wikki

Three words to the whack, step yourself back
Just gettin' down, and you then you're givin' no slack
Like a Burger King with a sack of Big Macs
We're throwin' down with the radical sacks
On time, in your mind you see
You gotta boogie to your best ability
You gotta funk it up until it knocks you down
And when you're funkin' up, be sure to pass it around
Come on, let's go to work
We got what'll make your body jerk
Make you throw your hands up in the air
Shake your booty and scream, Oh, yeah
Cause we are the Jam On Crew
And jammin' on it is how we do the do
We'll funk you up until you boogie down
So come people check out the sound
Check out the sound, check out the sound, check out the sound, check out the sound
Check out the sound, check out the sound, check out the sound, check out the sound

(Jam on it)

There's going to sound
They're going to get down

(Jam on it)

Allow me to introduce myself, my name is Chilly B
And I'm a surefire, full blooded bonafide house rockin' Jam-On Production MC
If you want the best, put me to the test, and I'm sure you'll soon agree
That I got no force cause I'm down by law when it comes to rockin' viciously, you see
Cause when I was a little baby boy my mama gave me a brand new toy
Two turntables with a mic, and I learned to rock like Dolymite
Time went by, on this God creation, I knew someday I would rock the nation
So I made up my mind just what to do and I joined with the Jam On Production Crew
So go crazy, go crazy, don't let your body be lazy
I said don't stop the body rock till your eyesight starts to get hazy
Clean out your ears and you open your eye, if you wanna hear the music just come alive
If you don't know how get ready to learn
Cause Cozmo's takin' his turn to burn

Take the C and O and the Z
Then they add M-O and the freaky D
Add a funky beat, and then what do you see
It's Cozmo D, yeah, baby, that's me
I've got the beat that's, oh, so sweet
Without me rockin' it's incomplete
So rock this, y'all, rock that, y'all
Rock on and don't you dare stop
You rock this, rock that, and that's a fact
Cause the Jam On Crew will rock your body right back
Rock a steam locomo ride off the track
And give the whole wide world a funk attack
A to the beat y'all, get down
Let me rock it to the rhythm of the funk sound
From hill to hill, from sea to sea
A when Jam On's rockin' everybody screams (Jam on it)
Jam on it
Jam on and on, on and on it
And if you're feelin' like you wanna dance all night
They go on ahead and flaunt it
Cause jammin' on is what we do best
It's what separates us from the rest
And if you go deep, I'll cruise down for real
Let me tell what happened to the man of steel

(Said Superman had come to town to see who he could rock)
(He blew away every crew he faced until he reached the block)
(His speakers were three stories high with woofers made of steel)
(And when we boys sit outside, he said "I boom for real")
He said, I'm faster than a speedin' bullet when I'm on the set
I don't need no fans to cool my ass, I just use my super breath
I could fly three times around the world without missin' a beat
I socialize with X-ray eyes, and ladies think it's sweet
(And then he turned his power on and the ground began to move)
(And all the buildings for miles around were swayin' to the groove)
(And just when he had fooled the crowd and swore he wouldn't fight)
We rocked this bet with a 12 inch cut called Disco Kryptonite
Well, Superman looked up at me, he said, 'You rock so naturally'
I said now that you've learned to deal, let me tell you why I'm so for real
I'm Cozmo D from outer space, I came to rock the human race
I do it right cause I can't do it wrong
That's why the whole world is singin' this song

(Jam on it) Jam on it
I said jam-j-j-jam on it
As days turn to night and night turns to day
Whatever time it is i wanna hear you say
(Jam on it) Jam on it
I said jam on-on-on, jam on it
Jam all around and upside down
And keep jammin' to the Jam On Production sound

(Jam on it) Jam on it
I said jam-j-j-jam on it
I said Jam On is the funky beat that takes control
With a sure shot boogie that'll rock your soul
(Jam on it) Jam on it
I said jam-j-j-jam on it
Get outta your seat and jam to the beat
And don't you dare stop till early mornin'

Jam on it, jam on it, jam on it, jam on it, jam on it, jam on it, jam on it, jam on it

(Yeah, that's how you do it Cozmo)
(You were right, kid, that's the way you do it)
(Yeah, like did you see when he went in the corner)
(And he started doin' this)
(Wikki-wikki-wikki-wikki)
(Wikki-wikki-wikki-wikki)

(Ah, man, this is too funky for me)
(I'm goin' home)
(Hey, Mergatroid, let's go)
(Hey, you fellas seen my sister Mergatroid)
(She was standin' over here just a minute ago)
(Yeah, I think I saw her over there with Randy)
(He's rockin' the mic, you know)
(Diggy dang diggy dang da dang dang da diggy diggy diggy dang dang)
(Diggy dang diggy diggy)

(The beat is fresh y'all)
(Yeah, fresh)

Said don't you hear the sound
Jam On is gettin' down

      Food Fight
     </title>
     <lyrics>
      [Intro: Humpty Hump (Del)]
This is a federal food fight
(You better know it!)
That means we're callin out all you kooks and crooks
(What?! We're about to rip this shit)
Oh, me? My name is Humpty Hump
(There's a party in here, baby)
I'm the original big-nosed rapper, baby
(You better get down with this, baby)
We're about to sling hot food all over this piece
(Just nothing but a food fight!)
Here we go, back in the house for the 9-whatever
(Foood fiiiiiggghht)
With the bacon and egg sandwich

[Humpty Hump]
You ain't bringing groceries, g
Your groove is getting rude over records
But can you sling the food like this?!
You better bite this
If you wanna make the people move like this
Chez wa, Allah, cheese burger
Flame broil base, my pickle make ya wiggle
You're busted, my mustard will wax your whole plate
By itself, not including all my funky condiments
Nod your head to this and DUCK DOWN
As I commence to lock and load a fresh cantaloupe
Yo, I'm illin! I'm slingin melons
Like the felons are slangin dope sacks
So max but I wouldn't stand so close up in the light
Either bring it or hide
Cause it's about to be a food fight!

[Chorus]
(You need something for the food fight!)
We hit you in the neck with a cheeseburger
(Gotta bring food to the food fight!)
Yeah, bruh, we hit you in the neck with a cheeseburger!

[Del]
It's classic
Slapping brothers with some lettuce from jurasstic
I counteract it with the Shock with ham hocks
&gt;From brothers who might Tupac
Fifty-seven black [????] and lots of flows
Fat like hippopotamoes, still caught em though
In the face with excrements, peep my testaments
I bring the seasoning paprika
Eureka for the weaker, and smoke the reefer
Dribble up the funk in the beaker
And, yes, about to say Âspeaker'
It leaks in your ears and years ahead
I went to Japan and they was throwing pork balls
But I'm calling protocol, stooop!

[Chorus]
(You need something for the food fight)
We banked you in the neck with the cheeseburger
(Gotta bring something for the food fight)
Yes, we're slugging the chicken nugget to your grill
(You need something for the food fight)
Get ready, we're coming fetti with the groceries
(Gotta bring food to the food fight!)
Someone shoulda told ya, it ain't over till it's over

[Humpty]
Now if I am what I eat I hope I ain't a big couchie
Gotta substitute the Âouch' for the Âooch'!
If so, I hate to see my man Donnie O, he'd be a butthell
Substitute the Âell' for the Âole'
Actually, factually hella fools I know would be toe up
If you was what you ate, no fakin
My man Nate would be a plate of bacon
My brother Shock popcorn, and my cat would be a rat
My girlfriend would be some super sperm and things
My rich nigga Pac would be a lobster with hot wings
It's quite simple, if true that my temple is wrecked
I'd be some mushrooms and cognac
I'd be a pinto bean gravy smothered neck bone
Scrilla taker, vanilla wafer, baker, filler
So come on with your food slingin cause I'm ready
Bring it Â­ SHUT UP! Nigga, sing it

[Chorus]

Bring the groceries

      Nasty
     </title>
     <lyrics>
      [Verse 1]
We're going to try and keep this rhyme real clean
But you know we're just too goddam mean
And yes little sucker we're all about the green
Not stamps, not suits, not your green ass shoes
But listen when we tell you, 'cause you think your  dick grew
High class sneakers are ready to play
You said, come on nappy head nigga coming your way
We got to the party late that night
Fine ass bitches looking dynamite
We was dressed in leather and Egyptian lace
Big ass behinds with a tiny little waist
We walked in the door, then a nigga want to dance
Old nasty motherfucker don't stand a chance

[Chorus]
He's Nasty
Too Nasty
(2X)

[Verse 2]
Black ass nigga want to take us out
Talking all that shit, flaunting all his clout
Black ass nigga was draped in gold
Driving Mercedes with a portable phone
He was a big ass nigga, about six foot six
But the big motherfucker didn't have no dick
Black, White, Puerto Rican
Nasty ass niggaz, you're all I'm freaking

[Chorus]
(4X)

[Verse 3]
You want a fine ass hoe to take to the fight
Old fake ass nigga, your money ain't right
So the next time you see us, don't even call our name
Nasty ass niggaz, we ain't playing your game
Now here's a short story about a nasty ass nigga
He's a player, a dapper, and a bitch slapper
He can even wear the title of a nasty ass rapper
He sings dirty rap, talking about t the cum
But he's perpetrating fucking seven days out the week
He talks like this is true, which is none of the sort
He ain't getting no pussy, 'cause his dick is too short
Yeah I said you were ready to play
This ain't Burger King, you can't have it your way
Do anything and keep my mouth shut
Hmm, come over here, let me show you what's what
Suck on this
Step out of line, and you will get dissed
Old nasty motherfucker, you ain't no risk

[Chorus]
(repeat and fade)

     <lyrics>
      [Chamillionaire]
Look..
My car sittin' as low as the IQ of kids on short yellow busses
Comin' slow like a cripple handicap kid, on crutches
Got more ice then Miller Light and a 100,000 slushes
Got somethin' in my clutches made for niggaz holdin' grudges
Poppa lookin' for a bootlegger I can abuse tonight
My princess got cut and I ain't even used a knife
You want me to lose my life, because you know you'll lose ya wife
When ya see me, you'll try to fight and then you'll be a loser twice
You as broke as the answering machine that never wants to answer
All eyes on me like the tat on a top-less tittie dancer
Is Chamillion cheap? Yeah..Enn nigga wrong answer
Screen fall's bout to Reign-Deer like Glitchen and Prancer
Ya misses wishes to give me kisses and be my Mrs'
Sit on more damn deep-dishes then some friend up..catfishes
I make myself laugh, twinkies out-crawlin' ya
I'm worth the price of a country so they call me Zamalia
You can call me baller trainer, when I tell ya I'm the boss
You want a verse and I don't like you, I'ma jack up my cost
I want a burger and a french fry, do that come with sauce?
I want a 'lac with a jumble-jack jack do that come with gloss?
We as throwed as a softball after the pitcher toss it
Paint wet as a leaky faucet, drippin' also when I floss
It's the..Chamillionaire, Hakim, Super Doopa King
Hoes say that I can sing, but I still do know bling

[Chorus - Papa Reu]
We got..hella TV's twinkies too
Call up Ron C when I need to be chopped &amp; screwed
Hoppin' out shinin' in ? to make em' bling
Watch me go bling bling, bling bling, so gleam
So please not ? from the gutta
???

(OG Ron C - Talking)

     <lyrics>
      I can't understand it V the beat bandit
who bring heat from the mic unhanded
who ever go after burn their hands and lips
a lot of rappers ran and abandon they whips

It's just another day in the Dunia
don't leave your girl around V he might swoon her
up and under the window serenade her like a crooner
stay ahead of the game and cut her off sooner rather later

Use her to gather data
scoop her in the butter soft moon roof Navigator
or the Land or the Lex or the Benz
a hundred and sixteenth buy the hours from the africans

But they won't let you push 'em
one tried to get fly, almost had to mush him
If I wanted to rob him, I would've worn a mask
hit him with the fo', took the dough and tore ass

Want not, waste not, front not
they didn't see him dippin to the fiftycent blunt spot
V walk the town with space boots space suits
fucked up cut but she still say his face cute

Told the streets, what you staring at?
the sewer cap opened up and said: WHY YOU WEARING THAT?
He said "Oh you wanna snap, pissface,
the way you in everybody's business is a disgrace"

At the park gate "Hark who goes there?"
It's V the MC who's nasty as nosehair
you may go he said you should've been say so
tipped him in cash and Argentinian pesos

There you go, my good man
buy something nice for the seed
and please keep it moving twice the speed
consider that your fair warning
or else I'll bring it to you express like airborne

Vaughn, drop a turd on the beat
and shoutout that little bird for the word on the street
he write VIK in a sick demented handstyle
and go bombin with a chick who whip a rented van while
all he say is you nuts
he really had enough of poo puts and crewcuts

Soup's on and I got a coupon
chinese restaurant asking for the Grey Poupon
he said "No, duck sauce soy sauce
And this ain't no Burger King so you no get no toy boss"

Uh oh it's beer o'clock, I think I'm sober
how about we think this over, over a can of king cobra
you ain't nicer than a lunatic schiester
aka the vicster, or the vic miceter
he wondered should he get a baldie
or keep his edge up, v-shaped like by my waldy

But that is the question, he wonders why he always
wearing hats in the sessions
listen up, new drink
named it after Chong's daughter
triple shot of 'gac, with the chaser of bong water
V a strong supporter
a triple shot of 'gac, with the chaser of bong water
come on bring the slaughter

      There It Goes
     </title>
     <lyrics>
      Damn
Give it time man
I'ma be alright
It's fucked up
I'ma be alright
At least I got my rydas, tho
Yea

There it goes
Anotha casket dropped unda
In the midst of the rain and thunda
And I wonda
About that watchin' this risk
And why I didn't take that bitch
Anotha funeral
Third night this week
Everybody and they mamma catchin' slugs in the street
I know the reverend by name
He's like Bullet
It's your turn ta run ta Burger King

Mamma told me I had three strikes in life
When I was 18 I got a job at Mike's
Car wash
The place where the bitches be
Till I got mad and slapped Mike and his homie
They called the pig
Then they called my Pop's
I pissed on the vacuum in the back of the shop
It broke on out
Now the cops is on my tail
Cherry on the bitches (?)
If a nigga only fail (?)

Chorus x2:
I'ma Be (Alright)
I'ma Be (Alright)
I'ma Be (Alright)
I'ma Be Alright, but (There it goes)

I coulda been a doctor
Maybe even a president
Instead I slang dope
In a crackhouse resident
Raised in the strip
By pimps and O G's
Rock a girl with ADIDAS
Till the age of 13
Till I caught by the pigs
Slangin' bags and such
Had every last dopehead
Ridin' my nuts
Felt like I was on top of the world
What a head won't do for the bag of a white girl
I had T.V's and VCR's
Stereo systems and stolen cars
More throwaways in the bottom of the river
When I was hungry
Crackheads brought me dinner
I kept Trumph on my bankroll
If I met a fine bitch I'd put her on the stroll
Everything was straight till they raided my spot
Now a nigga on the run and the fever gettin' hot

Chorus x2

Where my one good last thing at
Used ta flippin' money on hos
Now it's smack
You should be a Ryda
Heh, picture that
Now where the fuck's my pipe
For the crack
No more hatchet rydas got my back
Got me a penetrate in my black Cadillac (AHHH)
There it goes
Or it seems
Until I woke up from my...

Dreamin' of the money and the cars
Ho's in the strip bars
Now I'm all alone
To buy a couple fallin' stars
On the bottom of the barrel
Lookin' for a hookup
And when it's all done
I watch everyone book up fast
Spendin' all my money
People hate my ass
And now I'm really out of cash
Keep your money and your friends tight
Leave dem ho's
Or you can wave it all bye nigga there it goes

Chorus x4

Oh an one more thang
I'ma be alright tho
I got my rydas wit me

      Tell Me When to Go
     </title>
     <lyrics>
      [Hook] - 2X
Tell me when to go... Tell me when to go...
Tell me when to go... Tell me when to go...
Go dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb

[Verse 1: E-40]
Ooh; Jesus Christ had dreads, so shake 'em
I ain't got none, but I'm planning on growing some
Imagine all the Hebrews going dumb
Dancing on top of chariots and turning tight ones (eeerrrrr!)
Ooh, tell me when to go (dumb)
Talking on my Ghettro on the way to the store
... My 2nd or 3rd trip
Some Henny, some Swishers and some Listerine strips
Dr. Greenthumb lips, just to ease my thoughts
Not just the cops, but the homies you got to watch
The moon is full, look at the dark clouds
Sitting in my scraper, watching Oakland Gone Wild... Ta-dow
I don't bump mainstream, I knock underground
All that other shit, sugar-coated and watered down
I'm from the Bay where we hyphy and go dumb
From the soil where them rappers be getting their lingo from

[Hook] - 2X
Tell me when to go... Tell me when to go...
Tell me when to go... Tell me when to go...
Go dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb

[Verse 2: Keak Da Sneak]
I'm off that 18 dummy juice
.... Yadamean, labeled the Black Zeus
King of the super dooper hyphy (hyphy, hyphy, hyphy, hyphy)
And your wife, she don't like me (like me, like me, like me, like me)
From the Bay to the A
Put me in the back wood, Swisher sweet bud, laced dope
(Let's go) Bitch is some shit I wrote
I said they couldn't be saved by John the Pope (John the Pope)
I slid past on the gas, let the bitches at me
It's good, it's good like the granddaddy
Cross game, you get flipped like a burger patty
Or zig-zagged... pass me a big old fatty
.... I drink white, with a snow bunny
Talking big shit in the scraper, going hella dummy
1800, Jose Cuervo
Yadada mean, yadada I'm saying though

[Hook] - 2X
Tell me when to go... Tell me when to go...
Tell me when to go... Tell me when to go...
Go dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb

Now let me direct traffic homie (talk to 'em)
Let me tell ya'll about this Hyphy Movment
We got goin in the Bay
When I say something you say it right back at me
We swear we gon do it like this here... (Ohh)

[Outro: E-40]
[4X] Ghost-ride the whip
[8X] Now... Scrape
[4X] Put your stunna shades on
[2X] Now... Gas, brake, dip, dip
[4X] Shake them dreads
[4X] Let me see you show your grill
[4X] Now... Thizz face
[4X] Doors open, mayne
[4X] Now... Watch 'em swang
[2X] Go stupid, go (dumb, dumb)

[Hook]  - 2X
Tell me when to go... Tell me when to go...
Tell me when to go... Tell me when to go...
Go dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb

      Tragedy
     </title>
     <lyrics>
      Intro: RZA

Word up; Wu-Tang up in this joint
Wu-Tang Forever
Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang
Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang Forever (here comes the rain)
Word, Wu-Tang Forever (here comes the rain)
Wu-Tang Forever, the Ryzarector in your sector (here comes the rain)
From Shaolin to the holy city of Mecca (here comes the rain)

Verse One: RZA

Yo, yo, assassination, vaccination, poor education
infatuation with Satan with global nataion taxation
Fiberoptic microscopic biological germ
Mad Cow burger on the market, Captain of your starship
I never departed once I started
to explore these regions that was uncharted
Leave your heart broken, yo I stand tall
like buildings on Van Dyke's, all mics
Beats strike like a noisy four train late night
Chase got New York for the Life, we out of state
Can't smoke a bone in the staircase with out gettin chased
Penny candy poisonous rappers, best to chill or get your head gashed
Lemonhead, sour patch kids, best to grab
a Life Savor, I'll Jawbreak ya, Boston Bake ya
Then plant my sunflower seed on every square acre
The beauty of my nature shown through Shaquaisha I Mecca
When I made myself Equality, known to my reflector
Stay in your playpen boy, and babble for your formula and cried
You pacified, this lullaby from the black butterfly

Chorus: Tha Truth

Here comes the rain again
Falling on your head like a tragedy
Falling on your head causing new demotions
Not even...

Verse Two: RZA

Yo, yo, I'ma show this metamorph-is as the King takes his office
Keep my planets in orbit, never forfeit, or quit
move forward, I talk with the awkward slang
I walk with, the Wu-Tang, yo
Heavy thoughts can't be held down by the laws of gravity
Watch for the lime in the temple tryin to plot your tragedy
A game rank with, the high officials at the banquet
For attemptin to hijack the Wu-Tang Manual under his blanket
Can't interpret cause your brain is short circuit
This dumbness left your body numbness try to come amongst us
What's your angle? Rectangle or triangle?
As my truth of square drains you of your power the death angel
strangles you like a weed, choking the helpless flower, you cower
You feel the power of the final shower!

Chorus: Tha Truth

Here comes the rain again
Falling on your head like a tragedy
Falling on your head causing new demotions
Not even the naked eye, can see
Not e-eeven the naked eye, can see
(Tragedy)
Here comes the rain again (the reign of terror)
Falling on your head like a tragedy (fallin on your head like a tragedy)
Falling on your head causing new demotions
Not even... eye can see

Outro: RZA

Word up, word up Wu-Tang
Wu-Tang Wu-Tang
That's right, ninety-seven February
Wu-Tang comin at you, word up

     <lyrics>
      [Louis Talking]
You son of a bitch..
Grimey fuck..

..

[Louis Rapping]
I hate you from the bottom of my heart
Smart talkin' bitch, rap-pseudo intellectual chit chat
You don't have to ?wear a thought or peer at all?
When I heave a big axe at the back of your neck and head
And tear it off, soft, silly putty bullshit
I live to strip the flesh from off your bones, holmes
Homegrown slasher flick, spill the blood of pacifists
Kill your cousin and your kids, violent, nihilist
Stab your weak ass DJ wit' a stylus, right up in his eyelids
Never, never, ever sever ties
Unless it's severing the spine from the nerve-endings of a clever guy
Runnin' from a cop car, clothes soaked in the blood of pop stars
Murdering is not hard! It's only hard not to murder!
'Cause women just look sexier, when they're chopped to burger..
Sliced down to size 'til it resembles anorexia
What chick wouldn't want a naked killer standin' next to her?
I guess it's just, guess it's just, probably it's, obvious
My hobby is, slayings of the sloppiest degree!
I'm an ominous disease or a gift from God
Eating people is a job, dining on a human shish kebab
With a slob's mannerisms, I'm still wearin' lunch
From yesterday on my shirt, at my Sunday mornin' brunch
Old folks havin' aneurysms, when I hunt
On the news, women found with blunt
Objects jammed up in their cunt
We interrupt this broadcast for a special newsflash
Today I stuck a shotgun up this broad's ass (blam!)
Back to you Tom, bad news, reporting live,
Following a serpentine blood trail at the murder scene
Back to your regular program,
Of bludgeonin' yuppies with their cellular phone then
Carvin' a grown man, down to the shape of a child
Now find the outline and save it a while
I got a sentiment for dismemberment
And enjoy scrawling letters in blood with poor penmanship
I'm like dismember, disembowel, disavow
Show up at the precinct, and ask is this allowed
With a gouge in my forehead
Shaped like a crescent moon and star
And a shirt that says "I kill for Allahu Akbar"
So I'm only doin' God's work
Waitin' for some unaware, under aged chicks outside a concert
The monster, who strikes like clockwork
Guerrilla, serial killer, fuckin' stiff chicks until my cock hurts
I'm a terrorist, heavenless, specialist, pessimist
Ever since my dog started sendin' mixed messages
Chicks with big breastsesses, started turnin' up dead
Found on an altar with altered measurements
Effortless precision, sharp knife management
Executed by the champion of killin' transients

*Drums play until end*

      1, 2, 3... Rhymes Galore (From New York to Germany)
     </title>
     <lyrics>
      [Refrain (2x)]
1,2,3...from New York to Germany
do you wanna come party with me,
come join the family yo,
so let's flow yo

[Afrob]
Alle warn bereit dafür und schrieben dieses Stück
DJ Tomekk rief mich an, ich sagte zu und machte mit
hey, 1,2,3 von New York nach Germany
das war doch Flava Flav, der Turn von Public Enemy
und auch Grandmaster Flash und Jazzy Jeff
mit denen mal 'n Song zu machen, ey das fänd' ich Chef
das wird was großes voll die Dosis ich sag' was los is'
wie schlecht dein Reim oder wie gut deine Show is'
der unglaubliche vertrauliche ost-afrikanische, manchmal auch germanische,
Angst mach' ich Dir panische ,
als ich kam, hat ich 'n Plan, aber kein' Namen,
wollte alle MCs burnen, scheißegal wie groß sie war'n
heute rap ich meine Takte, natürlich nur Kompakte
biste cool, rauchste weed, denn ich kenn die Kontakte
da findet eine Menge statt, das kein Ende hat,
wir laufen Ränge ab, weil der Rest doch nur noch Scheiß- Gesänge hat,

Refrain (2x)

[Flavor Flav]
Yo Flash, yo Jazzy Jeff, yo Tomekk
Put the needle on the record,
Spin that shit back
Make the party people go crazy on the floor
This cut is world- wide boy we're goin' on tour
Iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiich liebe Dich- I love U G go catch your fish
whiting please that's what I want on my sandwich
I ain't got no burger meat so I ain't makin' no marriage
Flavor Flav back from the grave
Let me be your own I'm on the microphone,
Ther's a lot 'o people tryin' to be a Flava clone
But they got bad breath so they stand alone
If you wanna dance you got to play the band
My man my man my man my land
Stay your ass up Ku Klux Klan
I make you fuck your hand
Call up in the shame

Refrain (2x)

[MC Rene]
Sein erster Reim gab ihm den Kick
Der Groschen fiel es machte *klick*
Ja in diesem Augenblick war klar wo seine Zukunft liegt
Er musste auf die Bretter die die Welt bedeuten,
wollte rocken wie die andern Rapper vor ganz vielen Leuten,
Jahre ist es her der Anfang der ist immer schwer,
wie Schönheitschirurgie und Cher, das Mic und er, es wurden mehr
immer immer mehr die zu seinen Shows kam'n,
immer immer mehr die danach geflasht warn
er kriegt heute noch ne Gänsehaut
wenn er in die Menge schaut mit Funkeln in den Augen,
ich hab immer dran geglaubt
Flavor Flav un' Afrob
Mc Rene am Mic
Flash und Tomekk sind am cutten
Don't believe the hype

     <lyrics>
      (*talking*)
Yeah ha-ha, the way we shine
The way we grind, Play-N-Skillz
Big Tuck big bucks, we don't give a fuck
Yeah we shining we grinding, hey let's go

[Big Tuck]
The big boss man, with a boss plan
I got a loft man, you can run laps and
Without touching some'ing, it ain't much of nothing
But a lil' luxury, five place surround bumping
Get your paper right, you a stunner right
My house where the sight, living room Harley bike
We'll out-stunt that, Houston I'll stunt back
600 fuck that, McClaren nigga black on black
Plus a Maybach, dub-deuce black flat
I'll mase cats, box Chevy stretch that
I'm on another level, you better come too
Bring your funds too, new stones aqua blue

[Hook (*scratching*)]
Chain froze up, chain froze up
In a big body, in a big body
Chain froze up, chain froze up
In a big body, in a big body
Five leather change, five leather change
Five leather change, five-five leather change
Break bread with me, break bread with me
Break bread with me, five-five leather change

[Big Tuck]
Teeth stay glowing, Crys' stay po'ing
Hoes stay hoe'ing, they niggaz ain't knowing
Money making here, ain't no faking here
Ain't no stopping here, big house and belvedier
All my diamonds clear, meet me at the Cube Appear
Cocaine Pier, come back with a souvenir
I'm a cookie cooker, call me cookie booker
Grade A fish scale, like pure sugar
You know the caine'll hook ya, make ya hook a hooker
Where your bitch at, I guess them pimps took her
Well let that hoe go, bug you a kilo
If it ain't Cuban, fine you an amigo

[Hook]

[Big Tuck]
Gotta get this cash, pop tags Louis bags
You at Six Flags, we tour at six flags
Keep a big stack, hood mall-rats
That is a fact, I got a big mack
Ain't it ain't a burger, bang may scurr ya
Stud custom inserts, and they will serve ya
New Gucci linen, rap style's forbidden
Paris, France, New York even Great Britain
You soft as a kitten, your hobbies are needless
I'm swinging they miss us, rap deadly when bitten
Your cubics are foggy, my diamonds stay glossy
Haters they lost me, cocoa Foose in my swaucey

     <lyrics>
      Yo, yo, yo...
Ow! Motherfucker, sneakin in your backyard ??
Wit your daughter, naked, ha ha
What you know about it, what you know about it

[Redman]
Yo, why you buggin?
I stick a 16 shot slug in your ear
Put it to my dick so you hear me comin
I.C.U. critical, up on a stretcher
The 45 undresser, put on the pressure
You need a bulletproof overall suit to protect your neck up
You dealin then shuffle the deck up
Fuck the IRS, I'm the NRS
Nigga Revenue Service, talico inserter
Murder, a six letter word to convert a
Beef you better off flippin beef at Fat Burger
Yo Keith, pull out the burner
(he won't move any further)
Yeah, tannin your body more than white boy surfers
I carry tools like Sears Surplus
So when I spit you catch heart murmurs
Word, you sweeter than cupcakes
I concentrate to blow blocks where your crew pump weight
Each generation, rules the nation
Rock more spots than a hundred one dalmations
I'm not a hog I'm a big dog wit big balls
Lock it down like pit jaws to Crenshaw
Then y'all be like
He's jiggy like fat bitches wit cellulite
Chicken might dine like cops
First of the month these thugs
Will leave your bones in harmony from the slug
I beat pussy down when I'm smokin the la
Bitches leave the room screamin "Oh na na Oh na na"

[Erick Onassis]
E dog the mic demolitioner
The black superhero Def Squad's the clique, we rock shit
Cuz we flossiest
No thug cats show us often this
We the boss in this
Why think of double crossin this
Your first joint so wack it made me confused, forget who I be
I'll catch you eye then, ya heard
I live the life that's quite chill
On the hill wit a glass of water and 20 mil
Believe you me, E
I got a fresh flow I keep it blazed like dat fo' sho'
Some cats are sheisty, so I pack toast
My name aint Next and, y'all Too Close
The rap emperor, scorchin hot
Be the temperature, let's see, think I'm funny
I make you laugh goodfella
I smack you down in front of your fans
Then watch the show, in the stands, nigga
Don't fuck around that's what I mean yo
Def Squad comin through again, El Nino

[Keith Murray]
And why should we listen to you, anyway
You's a sucker MC wit a sucker DJ
I hit you with the all in the hammer
Cocksucker, niggas in DC say bammer
Master thrasher, on a binge for revenge
Make a hardcore nigga cry when I kill all his friends
And force destruction wit my coalition
Bang a nigga in the chest for frontin when he should be listenin
I comes through too true
Like a half pit, half man, HOO HOO HOO HOO HOO!
Shut the fuck up, fuck you part two
I kill a rock and put a brick in the hospital

     <lyrics>
      * send corrections to the typist

(Chorus: Murphy Lee)
These streets, is way too crucial
I just don't know, 'bout fuckin' with new hoes
These streets, is way too crucial
I just don't know, 'bout fuckin' with new hoes

(Hook: Ali)
I keep the same flock, treat em good
Get they mind right, and take em out the hood
Fuck a new ho, I keep it real though
Buy em new clothes and shit, but, um, no dough

(Ali)
Like Presents, she worked at the liquor sto'
So I don't pay for blunts or them bottles of Mo'
She got the hookup, she loves to bone
She love the way the new Q sittin' on chrome
She love the way the hood, talk about it
How it used to be rowdy, calmed down and got bout it
I can't doubt it, it's deep more than just sexin'
It's conversation buildin' the Earth based on lessons
Pussy ain't shit without a brain behind it
Got these queens actin' like hoes simple-minded
Never overzealous, I gasp at what a lady tell us
Keep it peace to God, love Allah, never fellas

(Chorus: Murphy Lee)

(Hook: Ali)

Like Moon she conservative, stackin' the funds
Manage Foot Locker so I keep Air Force Ones
We sit and talk, net game, net lost
Portfolio, she a broker I bought
Two cribs in Spanish Lake, one in Burlington down
She put me on at no fees, just me around
It's sufficient, ate your momma Diva in the kitchen
Veggie burger with cabbage, fresh water lavish
She study and meditate, part-time student
Work a lot, only I can hit the spot
Showin' self-control, controllin' my soul
Easy come, easy go, but all women ain't hoes

(Chorus: Murphy Lee)

(Hook: Ali)

(Ali)
Like Crane that's my boo, I got nothin' but love
She got a fat ass she work at the gentlemen's club
Straight freaky, straight kinky, straight wild
She like to ride but she love dogs with style
Only if her son ain't home, even though we grown
That's somethin' she want him to come to on his own
So we do a lot at Radisson and Embassy Suites
Sometimes we don't make it, end up in the backseat
She go to Fontbonne, low cuts to class
Keeps the boys horny, and the faculty mad
But it's real with me, do you I got the back
Cause me and you connectin, it's hard to find that

(Chorus: Murphy Lee) x2

      Women Turn on Your T.V.
     </title>
     <lyrics>
      [Kool Keith]
Don't hurt 'em - don't hurt 'em
Kool Keith... yeah
New York City in the house
California in the house
Texas in the house
Miami in the house

Forget sneakers that look like hot dogs
Yo fam, you hear me chewin your chicken gizzards
I'm more reptile than 10 of your Timberland boots
is worth one pair of my lizards
Just order your two-piece Kentucky Fried to go
That watch on your arm you said it was real?  You lied you know
Actin like a Spanish guy goin crazy over one girl
The latest thing in New York - overprotective insecure asshole
A J-Lo lookalike with a Burger King stomach
Man go ahead and hide your ho, my flow hit Mexico
And enter Puerto Rico like Tego
Rewind no fast forward, a lot of stamps on my passport

[Chorus 2X: Kool Keith]
Woman turn on your TV, channel 7, ABC News, don't you see me?

[Kool Keith]
So what you didn't vote for me, I'm Congress
My pee stains tag your white Dodge Magnum
Make the girls come out and say what's that on your armrest?
Security forces, ask the fire department I alarm best
With overcooked mushrooms, and turnips
I woke my kids up, y'all tryin to battle me all night
Suckers went to bet on the pro
9 million rappers, fell asleep with cigarettes in they hand
Let they babies burn up
Your girl ain't payin attention, who that on the bell?
Yo let my cousin Verne up
Alright, y'all get enough to build your concern up
Adjust your football game, break your PlayStation controls
Y'all know my highs, gorillas can't feel my lows
Cineplex status

[Chorus] - 1.5X

[Kool Keith]
Remember I'm Boston, they Bernie Williams
With a sweat over your ties, two outs in the 9th inning
Most of y'all stuck in Jeapordy
I answer you quick, shock you like Ken Jennings
You can't touch the mic lookin like the face on the penny
Goin against nuclear power
Marble floors with ceramics, I defecate in your shower
It's not about comin off the head of the testicles
My job is to make a foe write one verse for 30 hours
No fancy restaurants, and botanical gardens
A lot of guys with fake talk
I see 'em all out there with pink GMC trucks
Hand another man flowers, my competition wear haltertops
And sport backs with a lot of powder
Change your exits, comin up the road on your navigation
Meets the rerouter

[Chorus] - 2.5X

     <lyrics>
      [Sean Price]
I'm such a failure, hehe, ha hah
P!! First of all I'd like to say - nothin really
This beat is just so cool, you know you just wanna relax and
say some old cool shit (word) but that's not me (nah)
P!! Let's go

Aiyyo, supersonic chronic got my mind ease
But, never think that the God won't squeeze
Sean is the man, and I'm doin all that I can
When I rhyme, feel like the world's in the palm of my hand
All I is is all I am
And, all you is, who gives a damn?
It's like, wop-babalu-bop-doo-wop-bam-boom
The glock, got a few shots, you popped, drop - oooh
I'm buck with the words, I went to school
When I pop you with the tool, catch a slug from a nerd
That's my word to my mother
You act stupid duke I'm hurtin your mother like "WHAT BITCH~!"
Commence to smackin her face like a pimp
Then put the old bitch back in her place
The beat is smooth, the rap is hard
Just the way I like it bless the mic of the God
It's violent

[whispered] It's violent, it's violent, it's violent... {*3X*}
Bless the mic of the God, it's violent
[whispered] It's violent, it's violent, it's violent... {*2X*}

Yeah... aiyyo
Timberland boots I got stomp out your grill
Sean Price, the nicest nigga in Brownsville
Word bond, y'all niggaz can't rap worth a damn
The nine burst blam and earthslam your fam
Word to mother, my shit raw dog like fuck rubbers
Motherfuck literally, I fuck mothers
2006 I got a new bag of tricks
Boot Camp, J. League, new improved rappin shit
I'm a certified, fortified, forty-five holder
Been like that way before "Eshkoshkah"
We the best in the in-dus-try
We the worst when we in-the-streets
Got a verse nigga where's the beef?
Burger rappers screamin "Where's the beef"
You're soft, get lost, 'fore you scream where's your teeth
The beat is smooth, the rap is hard
Just the way I like it bless the mic of the God
It's violent

[whispered] It's violent, it's violent, it's violent... {*2X*}
Bless the mic of the God, it's violent
[whispered] It's violent, it's violent, it's violent... {*2X*}

P! Aiyyo

[repeat 2X]
This goes out to my Brownsville crew
Put your guns up in the air, don't kill me!
Buck 'em all day, buck 'em all night
We let off fo'-fo's

P!!

[whispered] It's violent, it's violent, it's violent... {*3X to fade*}

      (Chorus)
What them niggaz doin, chargin these hoes
What them niggaz doin, chargin these hoes
What them niggaz doin, chargin these hoes
Hoes, hoes, they ain't nothin but hoes
(2X)

[DJ Paul]
What the true players doin, ooh
They makin these hoes pay the motherfuckin cost, to the real motherfuckin boss
Pimpin is how I make my living, you fools need to keep paying bitch
That's why you gettin poor, I'm sturdy gettin rich
Why they payin these hoes I can't fear it after the bitch be chewin
Is throwin her whole fuckin back out and not get a dime after
What, ho I don't need ya, what I'm gonna eat ya, bitch I'm bouta beat ya
And what's up with them hoes who made the song Chewin Ass Nigga
Tramp ass bitch have you forgot that I had the picture
from the cam-corder in the closet, caught you hoes slippin
These bitches be gettin mad when they here
their name on the tape, they start to trippin
That's how it is fuckin with a Backyard nigga
My nigga Lord Infamous got fingers on the trigger
Aiming for your face, letting you hoes know the score
yo Juicy what the niggaz doin

[Juciy J] They chargin these hoes mane

[Chorus]

[Juicy J]
I met a little freak bitch, who always wore tight shit
Had five kids and her pussy had a tight grip
The first of the month came, the first of the month came
I saw the mail man coming now it's time to run game
Give me half the check bitch, niggaz like me never quit
Big nose red bitch, let your lips meet my dick
Pay up the money for the running of my cum on your tongue
Juicy Low Down J will never get sprung
Never was your friend see, all a nigga want is cheese
McDonald's, Crystal's, Burger King, Wendy's
Whatever kind of check it is, charging hoes is my biz
D-Magic, Project Pat, I know my nigga down for his
Yeah you hoes know the score, wanna fuck, gimme the dough
Credit cards, crazy checks, all that type of shit will go
To you little dirty freaks, keep my name out your mouth
Unless you want a job bitch, that's what I'm talkin about

      Getting Out the Game
     </title>
     <lyrics>
      [Kanye West]
There's only one girl on my agenda
(You talking bout Brenda?)
Naw I'm talking bout Linda, from last September
Now Linda love lace like Linda love lace
LaFace says she like +Mase+ but she love +Face+
And I know that Linda was a hip-hop-head
And I know that Linda gave Hip-Hop head
But I feel I could convert her
Cuz I ain't here to hurt her mayn
And she was messin wit me when I was still at Burger King
She ain't hop in my bed cuz of the whips and cream
Cuz when I had her in bed I had whip cream
Shakespearian midsummer night dream
I unzip things and pull out big things
They was flashin gr-green, she was like "ch-ching"
Got em, but she know a rreeal nigga when she, spot him
So now she's pickin dresses from Veroraiyn
Scratchin out her maiden and here's my name
Now I'm sittin at the bar wit all my guys
They sayin "Cheers to you for your future years of pain"
Like "Dog you ready to give all this shit up?
The summer's on its way and these hoes doin sit-ups
And when they see the way the G-5 lights lit up
Your gonna wanna have two like John Ritter"
But naww, I bought her a brand new BM
He said "Dog, slow down like Brand Nubian now"

[Consequence]
I just feel the need to purge my soul from the work load
Couldn't watch another nigga get burnt slow
She said her man was busy, always bored her with work load
Never takes her out and falls asleep in his work clothes
She needs some excitement, which leads to this indictment
Believe what you like kid, according to her
When we recorded with her, Linda changed her name to Nicky
Sang along to Darlin Nicky, co-star of my quickies
That foot is so pretty, but I'm sure you recognize
That bra holds titties, those are her titties
Solar's so pretty, but not to rub it in
But that white Russian did make her lonely like the wind
So the over right that's in, on the over night depends
If you take heed the game, and please keep ya name, word

[Kanye West]
Cuz she's just a playa playa
That's playin games wit me

[John Legend]
I can't see myself getting out the game, no time soon
Ooooh, as I continue as I, Ooooh, as I continue as I
Oooh, Oooh
Can't see myself getting out the game, no time soon
Ooooh, as I continue as I, Ooooh, as I continue as I
Oooh, Oooh

      Moneyearnin' Mount Vernon

     <lyrics>
      (Funky)	--&gt; James Brown

(Money, money, money)	--&gt; The O'Jays

(Funky)

(Funky)

(Money, money, money)

(Funky)

Get up, party people, listen to this rap
Cause I'm about to go down and put my town on the map
MC Heavy D, delighted you'll be learnin
About the place where I rest, Moneyearnin' Mount Vernon

(Money, money, money - MONEY)		(2x)

My town is really quaint, but we ain't no saints
And if you think we're pooh-puts, think again, we ain't
We're stormin strong, get taken out, never
[Name] Mob, stone cold terror
Not here to talk about that negative tip
Just makin sure you didn't make the mistake and slip
Not rappin all about the good times and chillin
But you can come and visit, homeboy, that's if you're willin
If you like it so far, you think you want more?
Come Uptown and I take you on a Heavy D tour
On Mount Vernon

(1-2-3 - hit me!)

(Money, money, money - MONEY)		(4x)

Born in Jamaica, Mount Vernon I grew
But I still do my shopping on 4th Avenue
Buy my Nikes from Chambers, then walk down the block
Get the gear that I wear from Buddy's Big Men Shop
When I start to get hungry and it's time to eat
Buy a burger from Shabazz on 4th Ave./3rd Street
I'll never forget the place I got my start
Around the corner from the crib, and it's called ([Name] Park)
Now in this park I'd bang a beat on a seat
Bust a rap for the crowd that was really unique
For an eight year old kid inside the 4th grade
And when I grew they all knew that I'd get paid
And on my way up I took no shorts on the court
I played and I slayed, I learned and I taught
And shortly after that everybody was yearnin
For Hev to go down in the town of Mount Vernon

Moneyearnin' Mount Vernon

(Fellas, I'm ready to get up and do my thang)	--&gt; James Brown
(Yeeeeah, gimme some mo')	--&gt; The JB's
(1-2-3 - hit me!)
(Funky)
(Funky)
(Funky)
(Gimme some mo')
(Funky)
(Funky)
(Funky)
(Gimme some mo')
(1-2-3 hit me!)

In the summertime, when the heat is hot
We can cruise on 3rd Street, but you can call it the block
Fly ladies out there in the short set suits
Nothin ugly approved cause all the girlies are cute
Would drive in my Blazer for a four-dollar fee
Written on the license plates is my name -
When it's time to chill we go to 4th Street Park
Pick up some brew from Big Lou when it gets dark
Go watch the summer league games, sip and forty and max
Cheer for the winner and watch the competiton get waxed
When that's all over it's party time
Come to the show and watch me go on a Heavy D rhyme
In Mount Vernon

      Why
     </title>
     <lyrics>
      So yo, why you trying to play me though?
Out like a sucker (Repeat 4x)

[Pharoahe Monch]
You're sneaking around like a sneaker baby, what's the beeper for?
Used to do my chores, now you're acting like a whore
Phones at my grip with you off to the store
For now, you don't love me no more?
Hey, by the way who's Curt?
Left a message on my machine said you didn't come to work
You AWOL from the job, plus who's Rob?
The way you're acting, I think you've been slobbing him
Sometimes I swear I think about robbing 'em
But my papa told me never to snuff no girls
You give 'em diamond, jewels, furs, pearls
Rings and shoes and cars and things
From time to time I wanna diss her
You couldn't play me if I cheated like Amy Fisher
And dismiss her from the courtroom in a Yugo
You know, something like Joe Buttafuco
Well deep inside my heart, the pain still stings
When I think back and remember I was gonna swing her a ring
For her fing finger, yes I used to bang her
Like "inga binga bunga" but I'm out like  Philip Summers

So yo, why you trying to play me though?
Out like a sucker (Repeat 4x)

[Prince Poetry]
I reminice back when I was swinging with Mish pretty young thing
she got a kick outta, my jeep and a meal at Burger King
And a shotta, ??? down with my maturity
Getting papers from Port Authority doing security
Uh, she just used to climb up in my whipper whip
Just to stress a nigga quick, young she's on a ego trip
Quit being "ha ha" I had to stop the pigeon
Step, find a dove who comprehends exactly how I'm living
So I met a girl around the way from the uptown
Set, we used to drown in sweat, uh
She was my dollar til I lost my 9 to 5
She started dissing listen pretend then shitting on my pride
She tried to crush my pride so cut off to the next
Uh, not for the sex, this one used to run through the projects
Gossiping with the next about the next
Loved to cover her neck, for stress gave her a cat as a pet (Meow)
It's major in a which, when she wanted to flow
Flowing with this nosey hoochie when I was out doing my shows
Doing a demo, demo, dembo, dembo
Dembo you can't front, you used to bust a load on Prince Po
And fall fast asleep into the morn
Girlfriend started flipping, so yo Prince had to be gone
I'm just another brother trying to get around the Feds
And keep my mental state, no matter what it takes

So yo, why you trying to play me though?
Out like a sucker (Repeat 4x)

      * send corrections to the typist

[Verse 1]
Ah..ah two times
Comin up, and I feel you and I done it up together
Crushed a qt time
And tha fun is up
Sun down, and the sun is up
Late at night night and day, you was up under me
Or I was up under ya
Punda ya
When I'm on the cut I can come to ya
And when I bust, you suck it up like a pundaba
You kept a bundle a under ya
Gucci or a Coach bag
Whatever ya got ya gave Smoke had
Thats why its so sad...when ya say (ta take meee)
And I gotta disappoint cha
Its not I don't want cha
Its that I got thangs to do peeps to see
Expensive champagnes to drank trees to tree
And drop mo hits than Tina T receive from Ike
And mo classics than rees
And Chevy caprice
So please be sweet
And believe in me
And understand ya can't be with me
But ya aint trying ta hear it cuz ya still screaming to me

Hook 2X
Are going
(Wh)Where are you going
(Ta)Take me...with you
Fore I die

[Verse 2]
Nah, nah, nah
Once there was this boy, this boy sixteen he had this girl
Loved her trusted her, boy would give girl the world
BUT he was working at Burger King, sorry hated him
Man he wasn't that popular, sorry hated him
He aint have no car..sttrrrike three
The boy dat got dumped was me
Wait time passed, like quarterbacks I moved on
Start doin mo bigga and betta thangs
Like tippers my cheddar came
UP..UP..AND AWAYY
HEY what do ya know
I'm on TV now
Can't help but see me now
Even Muslims, vegetarians want meet me now
But anyway....One night in the club I waayy in the back
You know...V.I.P. C.I.B.
Low-key
Like the midget locksmith...chillin
Listen..long story short bumped into my ex
Talked, walked her to the bar and back to the rooomm
We played doctor I played the part of the papsmith...
diggin all up in her womb
Next morning she said (Where are you going?)
Uh um wa..well I..I had was gone kick it with Craig a..and 'nem
Gotta Go!! See Ya When I See Ya!!

      Fit But You Know It
     </title>
     <lyrics>
      Excuse me girl
I know its a bit embarrassing
but I just noticed some tan lines..
On your shirt!

See I reckon you're about an 8 or a 9
Maybe even 9 and a half in four beers time
That blue top shop top you've got on IS nice
Bit too much fake tan though - but yeah you score high
But theres just one little thing that really really
Really really annoying me about you you see
Yeah yeah like I said you are really fit
But my gosh don't you just know it

[Chorus]
I'm not trying to pull you
Even though I would like to
I think you are really fit
You're fit but my gosh don't you know it

So when I looked at you standing there with your hoard
I was waiting in the que looking at the board
Wondering whether to have a Burger or chips
Or what the shrapnel in my back pocket could afford
When I noticed out the corner of my eye
Looking toward my direction
Your eyes locked onto my course
I couldnt concentrate on what I wanted to order
Which cost me my place in the queue I waited for YEAH

[Chorus]

Whoa! Leave it out
Are you smoking something?
Leave it out
Mike just leave it just leave it
We cannot have that behaviour in this establishment
S'not worth it mike, just leave it
Don't Touch Me, S'not Worth It
Don't Touch Me, D, Look I'm Alright Don't Touch me

For a while there I was thinkin - yeah but what if?
Picturin' myself pullin with bare white hot wit
Snarin you as you were standing there opposite
Whether or not you knew it I swear you didnt tick
And when that bloke in the white behind us lot queuing
Was clockin onto you too yeah I had to admit
That yeah yeah you are fit
And yeah I do want it
But I stop sharkin' for a minute to get chips and drinks

[Chorus]

Oy, just as you started to make your big advance
With the milkshake and that little doughnut in hand
I was like nah, I can't, even though you look grand
But you look sharp there smilin hard suggesting and
Gleaming away with your hearty hearty lookin tan
But I admit the next bit was spanner to my plan
You walked towards my path but just brushed right past
And into the arms of that white shirted man

[Chorus]

Oh what do I give .. I've got a girlfirend anyway
(whoa, we've all had a drink mate)
We're all a bit drunk, yeah we've had a few fair play
I got this stella I bombed from that last cafe
This nights not even begun, yes yes oh yay
I did fancy you a bit though yeah I must say
I would rather I hadnt mugged myself on display
But this is just another case of female stopping play
On otherwise a total result of a holiday

[Chorus]

     <lyrics>
      * send corrections to the typist

Yo Blaze you so nasty, you know you nasty
Man you so nasty, you know you nasty, yo Blaze you nasty

Scabs and bubble gum, peanut butter on ya toe nail
Flickin' boogers in ya ginger-ail
Get's my chain, bust ya in the face
Then wipe my butt, so now it's kinda itchay!
Drink doosh bags like wine coolas!
And throw gang signs for all the old schoolas!
I stuck an AK in a hoodrat booty
'Cause I found out she was a groopie!
If I blow ass, you gonna know fast
All y'all gone' need a fuckin' gas mask
I'm the yellow shit underneith ya armpit
And when I talk, that's fine, 'cause I spit
I'm like clay, wet, smelly and gray
I wore the same clothes forever and a day
Now you can hate me and try to say I'm trashy
And if you go &amp; ask somebody, they'll tell ya that i'm
nasty, that I'm nasty!

You nasty Blaze, you nasty
You nasty Blaze, you nasty
You nasty Blaze, you nasty
You nasty, nasty, you nasty, nasty x2

I'll use Anybody Killa rubber, after him
I aint payin' shit and time's costin'
Mo money, and not enough veel
Word to ya neden, I'm just tellin' the deal
I suck the pus out my own pimples
And spit it on yo ass and fill up the dimples
I'm the lint, in ya belly button
Fuzzy like Moe, aint that somethin'?
I like to fuck chickens, then 'que'em
Barbeque sauce on my balls just for screwin'em
I go swimmin', in a port-a-potty
And have shit and piss, on my face and body
I like to party, with my pants off
When my dick gets hard, smack it and it goes soft
I'll suck the blood, out a Tampon
I'm nasty as the mother fuckin' ground that I stand on
*Anybody Killa*"Only if you standing in a pile of shit!"

Chorus

I stay funky like a doo chip, I wipe
Snot on your bed spread, lil' sister pussy lip
I got mice sleepin' in the holes in my back
I tried to evict'em, they said fuck that!
Dirt under fingernails, wounds don't heal
Skrimp on my double burger, value meal
Take home some hookers, with no teeth
But still got lips and loopy ass cheeks
I'm the melted ice cream covered in ants
Got dried blood and guts on my favorite black pants
This one freeky bitch, tried to piss on me
So I sit on her, so that she can see
that killas don't swing like that
So open the neden real wide, and I stuffed in a rat
Why you think all the hoodrats ask me
"Blaze why the fuck is you so damn nasty?"

*Violent J* "Shut the fuck up bitch"

     <lyrics>
      (Intro)
Queen Pen: Me'shell Ndegeocello, play for me, c'mon talk to me
Me'shell: anyone know, it never ceases to amaze me how everbody's always in
somebody else's buisness, looking for something, but 'cha know, for what
it's worth -
we could give a fuck!

(chorus)
Me'shell: Girlfriend, girlfriend, yes i had your girlfriend
Queen Pen: If that was your girlfriend, if that was your girlfriend, if that
was your girlfriend, she wasn't last night  (x2)

(verse 1)
now how you just gon' be playa hatin' on me
coz i got mad bitches just wanting me
And i got mad niggaz just checkin' for me see
I got more stock than you ever see, i be...
The one that your main squeeze been diggin
Pull you out your closet, sex on weekends
It's my buisness of what i do, him or her, he or she, inside you
So while you be yappin' and talkin to your friends
Beefin 'bout that yellow chicken, the green benz
I'll be havin' all your people's info with the second part of my ???
she slid the number, what you gettin mad at me for
she said she was single when she closed my car door

(chorus)

(verse 2)
Me'shell: so queen tell me, where did you meet her,

Queen Pen: On the sunday, mac, she was walking out ???
I was just chillin, mindin my own business
Sittin on the corner, waitin for my sister
When she slid by, maybe 4 or 5 times
Wanted me to notice the rythm of her thighs
Oh boy, uh, girls are just so funny to me
I can see how niggas get into these beefs
She knew she had a man when she came up in the piece
She said she was a regular and how about me,
If she gave me her digits would i call her after three
The way she fliked her hips made you move to have to see
How these chinese jamaican tried to draw it by me
It never ceases to amaze me

Me'shell: Ain't nobody gotta know just how much you want me

(chorus)

(verse 3)
Now how i've ran, you've only a few
But you can  back track and ask them how i do it how it is
Who the flyest chick, with the phattest whip
And run her all night, like a burger with a chip
And if it's all good then i feature it again
Like a fix remix, (if you need a fix)
See you gots to be real like my ex beverly
You don't have your man just stressin out on me
Coz he can't control how you throw your pussy
I'm a baller and i been for a ???
And if i choose to jerk her off then it's all on me
See you claimed that was your girl, well that's not how it seems
Uh, it never ceases to amaze me

Me'shell: Coz i like to get down so if you's wants ta i will
I love to love ya'  baby

      [Carnival Beats]
{*scratching*}
"Like this and like that"
"Like this and like that"

Chorus: Carnival Beats
"It's like this and like that
The hood got my back
Yeah, I'm making paper stacks, slangin' muscle like crack"
"Yeah, I'm making paper stacks"
"Yeah, I'm making paper stacks"
"Yeah, I'm making paper stacks, slangin' muscle like crack"

Repeat Chorus

[Verse 1: Chingo Bling]
They say you never been caught
Boy, you must be lucky...
But don't go barking by my ties, you better hush, puppy
They never catch us all (Nope)
It'll never stop (Nope)
Anytime, any corner, baby, I'm a set up shop
As long as the trunk go pop
As long as the trunk open
I'm a steady be servin' them, boy, my hustler boat ain't broken
Flip it
Flip it
Flip it more than Burger King
We Houston's distribution
We be servin' thangs
The work is smuggled in my big belt buckle
The border got a fence, but we dug underground tunnels
We packed a pack two trucks on a road
So if they stop the first one, we lose half a load (Zim-zimma)
Got ostrich seats in my beamer
I'm a rep it for my people, you can put that on Salina/Selena
And right now
They got us cleaning up Katrina
Yo, Kanye, Bush don't like Mexicans either

Repeat Chorus Twice

(Verse 2)
[Chingo Bling] Stacks, rubberband' em, tamales, I Soundscan them
So next year
I could pull up in a brown phantom
They boys can't stand him cause he too, too, flashy
Went from
Ashy to classy, to downright nasty
[Male Jacker]  There he go
Oh, he [{*fuckin'*}] jacked
[Chingo Bling] Boy, I wish you would
Monte Carlo grippin' wood, same color as ese blood
Slabs on driveway to make 'em say "Ay guey!"
Pass ya on the highway, from viejas, from to MySpace
Mouth wide open, tongue hangin' like a pervert
When they see the rich Skittles, chain lookin' like some sherbert
I sold the maza just to see how the paper feel
David Copperfield couldn't cop a better record deal

Repeat Chorus Twice

[Verse 3: Chingo Bling]
Lately
I been havin' rich people problems
I made another couple million, hopin' that will solve 'em
Promise
Lookin' like I jacked your favorite rap star
Willie's chain, Paul's grills, Puff's house and Slim's car
They lookin' at me like
"Where in the [{*fuck*}] they found him?"
"Whoever the [{*fuck*}] signed him
I bet that they gon' fire him"
But it's official, Big Chile/Asylum
You know the three digits {*Carnival Beats scratching*}
You better dial him

Repeat Chorus Twice

[Carnival Beats]
{*scratching*}
"Chingo Bling, culero"
"The Ghetto Vaquero"

      [Sample]
"The question still remains, where is the money"

[A.L.T.]
Yo man
Check this out

(Verse 1)
I got pull like a trailer
I cuss like a sailor
I shop at the swap meet, never had a tailor
I don't really care
I'm broke as a joke
Yeah, I had a single, but the record didn't smoke
I drive a Toyota, it's older than Yoda
Mona wanna loan her, but I already told her
That I don't have a penny
I'm short of a nickle
Tried to buy a burger, but I only got a pickle
A brand new Pinto, only in dreams
I'm talkin' secondhand jeans and refried beans
But A.L.T. treats ya
Good money meets ya
I'll offer you a soda and a piece of frozen pizza
Girls wanna mingle
My pockets only jingle
Damn, I'm getting hungrier, so please buy the single
Don't ask for a nickle
And please take a hint
If you ain't got dollars
Then you ain't got sense

Hook: Sample
{*scratching*}
"Dollars and cents"
"Dollars and cents"
"Trying to get her hands on some doll-"
"Dollars and cents" --&gt; Ice Cube

(Verse 2)
Rhymin' up a funky rhyme and lyrics, yep, I got 'em
Plus I got sober, there's a hole in the bottom
Peeped out, and scoped out, the hons when I was little
Couldn't afford a guitar
I had to learn to fiddle
That was never cool, and all the honeys never liked it
They were always on the A.L.-I-will-take-a-hike tip
I love Italian food
The noodles
Alfredo
My spaghetti's good, but yo, it doesn't have tomato
Tomato
Tamoto
I'm a desperado
Mexicans win, but this one can't afford the lotto
A knock at my door
I open, it slowly
Jevohas, leave me alone, because my socks are really holy
If I get a crowd, yo, I try my best to rock 'em
I got some clever beats, and when I get a chance, I knock 'em
Don't ask for a penny
And please take a hint
If you ain't got dollars
Then you ain't got sense

Repeat Hook

(Verse 3)
I got some Chuck Taylors, so my shoes, they always stand out
I doesn't have a penny, but I won't accept a handout
Never had a radio, I had to stick to hummin'
Mom
Mom
The ice cream man is comin'
Her time is always out, so she always thought I planned it
Other kids got some, but I was empty-handed
I live with my parents
My room is always dirty
Mom said I can stay
But only til I'm thirty
I never had no money, but it really doesn't matter
If my record sales
Then I'll be livin' phatter
There a lot of people, so be cool and take a hint
If you ain't got dollars
Then you ain't got sense (Sense...)

      Keep it Real
     </title>
     <lyrics>
      'That's what the fuck I'm talkin' about
That real shit nigga'

Living room packed, laid back on the flow
Niggaz can't see me on the madden with Frisco
I'm runnin' fools straight to the dirt
While my man Train talkin' on the phone, the evil curse
Niggaz waste gas drivin' down the same streets
And hood rats wishin' for the passenger seats
Flag 'em down, like they flaggin' down to get a taxi
Too good to ride a bus, drinkin' is a must
Another day kickin' back, the scientist is hard at work
Thinkin' how to get paid, kickin' back in the shade
Or call Will and Temple where my homie down by Zeenie
With the bald head it's too hot for the beanie
Sittin' on the porch niggaz run the stop sign
Hookers sell they bodies 'round the way ain't hard to find
Right in the corner of McDonald's parkin' lot
Peepin' out their hair 'cause that spot is hot
And that's real

(CHORUS)(2x)
Nigga gotta keep my shit real
Lettin' punk niggaz know how the fuck I feel
Pussy ass niggaz always wanna be around
A nigga like Ren when I put that real shit down

Randy up the street cuttin' up the fresh fade
And Compton P.D. around the corner 'bout to raid
The yellow helicopter hangin' 'round like a gnat
And hood rats yellin' out a car where the party at
My robbin' train go and get a duce
And niggaz 'round the way don't give a damn about a gang truce
But I gotta lotta love for my people
And like they ain't tryin', niggaz just keep dyin'
I won't be like most niggaz and just come
And shoot my video in Compton and disappear for a year
We make fools like that shake the spot
One for the treble jack yo ass in the parkin' lot
'Cause handkerchief headed niggaz come around fakin'
Braggin' 'bout that money they be makin'
Boot lickin' butt dancin' niggaz just better chill
Before I tell 'em how I feel and that's real

(CHORUS)

Yeah, uh, break it down
All y'all busta ass niggaz
Do it like this, 1995
Uh, yeah, come all y'all fake ass niggaz to this

Goin' to the pad hit the beach up on the pager
Here comes Korleone up the street in the mini-Blazer
While the dominoes start to get shakin'
The same time that the barbique start bakin'
I don't eat swine, but I take a turkey burger
I can't fade worms, that books' full of terms
Homies pass by, some stop and conversate
On a gang a topics we start to debate
On why in black neighborhoods is always towed down
And white neighborhoods ain't one piece a trash 'round
So we gotta do for self and quit bitchin'
Recycle black dollars so we can roll Impalas
Every street got their own rap artist
On every cover every brother got a gun tryin' to look the hardest
But some deserve a slap 'cause they laid down they strap
When they hear that's a rap and that's real

      [Lil' Romeo]
Hut 1, Hut 2
Hut 1, Hut 2
Hut 1, Hut 2

[Lil' Romeo]
I'm lookin' for a girl who can show me around
Hold me down
Puppy love girl, how that sound
Remind me of a wish
First kiss
Can't explain the way I feel a lil young for this
When I see you all I seem to feel is happiness
Grab ya wrist
Girl you extravagant
Beautiful,
Beauty unusual
Aint gone stop 'til I get thru to you
What's ya name Ma
I wanna hang Ma
Feel like takin' a ride on the swang Ma
You my queen Ma
Be ya king Ma
I bring you everything in ya life you can think Ma
If we were older I'd give you a ring Ma
Take you to the concert where they sing Ma
For now I'mma let you do ya thing Ma
But if ya man turn out
He's not getting' a thing Ma

(Chorus)- 2X
[Allusion]
Twinkle twinkle little star
How I wonder where you are
Let's bounce to the spot
Baby take a ride
This song is just for you and I

[Lil' Romeo]
Got a spot in the shade
Cold lemonade
Man you hot from ya feet to ya braids
Dimples in ya cheeks
Love to eat sweets
Got a baby Humma so you and me can creep
Got me a phone in case you wanna speak
Let me slow down, it's getting' too deep
You call me what's up
Now I'm tryin' to eat
Don't even trip
Lunch's on me
McDonalds, Wendy's, Burger King
C'mon, it's on you
Do ya thang
Move ya hips
Make ya elbows swang
Wobble it girl, move that thang
Get crunked up,  I'mma use that thang
Hold up, you we do that thang
Hope you got friends, 'cause mine wanna hang
Here come the chorus again, now sang

(Chorus)-2X

[Lil' Romeo]
Gloss on your lips
Gloss when you kiss
Gotta be love if I feel like this
Love it when ya walk
Twist in ya hips
Everytime you speak
I swear my heart skips
Warm inside
Hot like July
Get butterflies when I look in your eyes
Last in my class
Friends getting mad
Can't wait to meet ya mom
And you can meet my dad
Smile a little more
You look so sad
You look too good to be seen like that
A boy should never act mean like that
I neva eva eva wanna see you look like that
Enjoy the night
Dim the lights
This cant be wrong
It feels too right
Turn the music up
Dim the lights
Rome-e-rome
I'm in the zone tonight

(Chorus)-2X

[Allusion]
My boyfriend (friend)
I can be your girl (girl, girl)
You can be my baby
Come and share my world
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon

(Chorus)-2X

      Let Me Talk to You
     </title>
     <lyrics>
      * send corrections to the typist

Libra
My name is Keith
We got some nice things for the ladies
Go get the ladies some flowers and stuff
Other people don't love them like we do

I never hurt you talk to you decent at night
And in the daytime I watch you while you sunbathe
And if it rains I bring you straight abouve the water girl
Let me bring you in the house and make some cope of your back
I am stupisfied you know I got my way up
I push you over a 300 just to keep me in the dirt
I love it when we hit the city you got the fireplace
I bring you fire in the a place
Why can't it be me and you
I see your chocolate brown skin
I see your peanut-butter skin breast make me feel like a child go feed me
I bite your rigth cheak and leave a monkey bite
Why can't we be one 'til we die
And if we die why can't we multiply
And if we cry I make sure that a wild kid like me takes care of home while
we two are take

(7x) Let me talk to you
I got some conversation

I'm not Babyface Jimmy Jam of the Lewis
When I look at you the sex male wanna do this
Taste you up and down
Bite the honey brown
Takes you hand up so we can go and have fun
Pope the grill out and everybody chill out
Got to play the little prince
Marvin Grey, sexual healing
You on the blanket I'm ready for fingering
Holding you in the grass whith your so bra jingelling
I got a fruit cocktail for your stomach
Some jellies and juicy fruits from Bellies when I rob it
I lick you there where he won't we lick you there where he don't
Bringing extra underwear to the picknic
Amen to excesy we can get love sick
so quick mick and hunble my ohhhhhh

(7x) Let me talk to you
I got some conversation

In the bathter looking for your bubble bath
With a condom you bout to make me wonder
Woman I drink your bath water like a beaver art
And pop the bubbles of your bath with my indexfinger
Drinking cups and teas in the fireplace
My hand is slight, touching on the right place
The G-spot I know you got a lot of loving hugging
Your juice is ooze how can I loose
When a woman loves a man
she'll bring her best friend with laundry over to your house
When a woman loves a man, she'll clean the grind off your feet

(4x) Let me talk to you
I got some conversation

Yeah baby you know I respect you for
Brought me to Burger King
Ride with me in my litty lorry you know sticking bombs sticking them
Yeah you know light castles be emotional
65 Shebbies can't afford the Benzes we can only fantasize
So you won't need them...

      In My Hood
     </title>
     <lyrics>
      [SPM]
One, Two buckle that fool
He's Fuckin with me, if he's Fuckin with you
Hillwood to my bones, to my chromosomes
Got two forty-fo's so I'm not home alone
Push a pencil like a stone on a Saturday night
I choke a hoe from my toad, like I'm grabbin the Mic'
They bought me a used Dirt Bike
A year later, it was used to serve white
Get a bird on top of us, punk ass officers
Mad, cause my closet full of guns and Nauticas
Rockin with duckies, for fiends and junkees
Got more cheese than Chuck E's, and get my weed from uglies
It's all lucky, just bought a Pitbull puppy
Its guaranteed to make me a shit full of money
Man I just couldn't study in school, I was nervous
So I left, I cant even write in cursive

[Chorus 2x]
What do you see, in my hood
I see gangstas everywhere, everywhere

[SPM]
And I'm going live, liver than the rest
I told my mom, while I'm locked, take it as a test
Up in Garza West, smokin on a skinny square
Three more, and I believe I can get me there
I'll be home soon, I promise that
I be trippin cause know they say my daughter rap
Seven years old (Carley:I'm eight now dad) they say she real cold
She my muthafuckin life, for real though

Lord knows that he got me here for a reason
What it is, I dont know but your boy breathein
They didn't kill me, so know them hoes gotta feel me
I've been slanging since I got kicked out of Milby
Last ten years, been a cold jungle
In the streets sellin dope to my own Uncle
Born thug, they goin to hate me 'till I'm bagged up
In my casket, I'll probably still be handcuffed

[Chorus 2x]

[SPM]
I come from the Slums, South Side Houstone
Changed to Screwstone, the day Screw moved on
And I miss him, wish I could hug and kiss him
He was askin' for help, but no one would listen
Remanicin, actin like a fool at Roxy
Jealous niggaz lookin but refused to box me
I don't blame them though, I would jump on stage and flow
And holla fuck the police on the radio
They can't stop me, but certainly them hoes could try
I started Dope House, back when I was smokin fry
In the pen, wish I had one mate
I swear to god these hoes hate to see us paid
Just made big spread, with roast beef
Got ma boy pullin weed, out his gold teeth
On the mic I destroy any earthling
My new song called pussy, weed, and Burger King

[Chorus 2x]

      Outta My Way Baby
     </title>
     <lyrics>
      [Pete Nice]
Pete Nice is in the house, ah Beatnuts in the house
Woop woop, Daddy Rich is in the house and we're about to swing it

"Outta my way baby! Man gotta keep on moving" (Repeat 2x)

Never got caught in the booty booty trends
As a youth peeped Red Alert on the weekends
Daddy Rich skills on the cuts like the butter
Head for the hills, jet go and tell your mother
Minister, sinister, a fist full of dollars see
Get with the vibes of my slick verbal tapestry
Never second guess cause your rep will start to crumble
Play the role of humble, if you follow, never stumble
Don't fret y'all if you think you're born the suspect
One day your record might boom in the projects
Say where you been, hey been swimming in the sewers
Cruising 24th street, picking up some brewers
Ya from, stung you with the lyrical artilary
Big rap money-making, please this place is for me
Like the E-Double said, "So Whatcha Saying?"
So get your fat ass out my way and

"Outta my way baby!"  "Big rap money-making nigga"
"Outta my way baby!"  "Man gotta keep on moving"

Here I come on the one with the burger on the bun
packing a ton, my water pistol weighs a ton, son
Some call me Jake, used to roll with the Fatman
Listen to my man, say Shawn's I'm a black man
Gave away the booty if the booty ever smelled up
Not the ??? with the frisk and got you felt up
Think I fall off, but let me tell you something
That's the day I see the white man jumping
Got the flavor of a Beemer 850
When it comes to tracks me and Rich is kinda pickey
Pete Nice and Daddy Rich swing and kick a verse
Step the way out my way out my way

"Outta my way baby!"  "Man gotta keep on moving"
"Outta my way baby!"  "Big rap money-making nigga"

Up in the Bronx where the people's kinda fresh and
Bought the Nike Air low cuts off the Jew man
Polish up a track like you polish up your five-stars
When I finish ripping, better check the stars
Bringing out the worst like a hearst in the casket
A question I ask it, a tisket, I tasket
Not the butter head cold chewing on the Grape Nuts
Beat style poetic with the butter of the Beatnuts
Took it overseas like the Lovetron Darryl Dawkins
Schoolyard ball, Roger Brown or Connie Hawkins
Walking like a duck, milk's the one but it's wispering
Sucking on pipes, but look at what it did to you
Pimping, scoring, the tour bus touring
Going to the Garden, see the Knickerbockers balling
Best believe we got the beat swinging
Peace to Mike Brady and I leave my man singing

"Outta my way baby!"  "Man gotta keep on moving"
"Outta my way baby!"  "Big rap money-making nigga" (Repeat 2x)

      Tears of a Clown
     </title>
     <lyrics>
      it's mines i want that give me that
ricky shake the party screamin "where the remy at"
spinnin like some rims on some daytons and vouges
and my my my how the indo goes
freeze like a frosty with the cappucino taste
nickname my product like cookies in the cake
like damn baby I'm lovin' your beautiful face
but my fillmoe heart got my whole mindstate
so illegal like moonshine ryme design
temper like a phoneix when i open my eyes
and mash on it crash on it blast on it
count your money put your stash on it cash on it
bring your lifejacket cuz you just might drown
have you ever seen the tears of a clown get down
bring yo life jacket cuz you just might drown
have you ever seen the tears of a clown

rapid fire from the empire wit no desire
walking on a tightwire born again liar
you might not understand my love for rap
but until then show me where the money's at
and my tigers want cognac kovosia
clownin on freaks anytime of the day
with no pause no shame no game no blame
tearin' up the streets in my all star chucks
i'ma liquidate em all wit unforgetable paragraphs
it was all for the money so we took the wrong path(POW)
I got bullets that'll crack the sky
hit nacys for a burger milkshake and frys
"nicky why" is what they say when I hit the set
with no reply I'm gettin' high so they gots to geuss
but bring a lifejacket cuz you just might drown
have you ever seen the tears of a clown get down
bring a lifejacket cuz you just might drown
have you ever seen the tears of a clown

dot dot dotta dot
dot dot dotta
dot dot dotta dot
dot dot dotta
da messy getin crazy lookin like a cry baby
bacardi at the party for the flyest young lady
i told you about the frostys wit the cappucino taste
but what about the cats wit the gats in ya face? check it
luxery weapons facsinate the brain
baby get your ticket we on soul train
with nicky nicky raps raps nicky nicky rymes
nicky nicky caps caps nicky nicky crimes
i mob through the city as i crank the beat
fire up tuff on the gangsta streets
steer to the reer like a clear alear jet
hit the corner like a shadow with the grey siloette
like rex what's next
i gotta keep it bumpin
i gotta clown something when the hoes start frontin
and why i stay high off mary j. blige
and when theres a drought all birds do fly
all through the air 'till they hit yo set
and if you talk too much then you will get wet
but bring a life jacket cuz you just might drown
have you ever seen the tears of a clown get down
bring a lifejacket'cuz you just might drown
have you ever seen the tears of a clown
(ohhhohhohh ohh hahahaha your killin' me man
hohoho your killin me hahahaha ohh shit)

      I Got a Seecret (Remix)
     </title>
     <lyrics>
      Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
These metaphors be broad
Check it, damn
Ladies.. and gentlemen
I got a secret
Somebody told me yo' ass stink!
Don't blame me!

Hah, what, huh..
Ah, one two three four
Huh, huh, yo
Huh, yo yo yo yo yo yo
(C'mere baby)
Yo, yo yo, yo yo, yo
Yo huh

Yeah, yeah, yeah, these metaphors be broad
Take the Shanks out of Shaw Redemption and hold it to your jaw
Climb aboard, jump out the ninety-ninth floor
That bitch on the salt box, know when I rain I pour
Shoot up the Mardi Gras with double chrome forty-fours
Full up plates, cause someone I'm ready to take yours!
Jungle music got my mind and body stimulatin
Hyperventilatin, you're talk of the town like date raping
Call me the Doc-casian Spot, The Beatles
Malfunction in the SL Board without the EQ
Fuck fuck fuck bitch I'll bust a nut all over that gut
Buck buck buck souflee you lay you then I'm hittin that clutch
It's where the blacks rub, what, fuck your back up
My dubs be filled with dust when I bust you definitely feel
the rapture.. ha ha.. HA HAH.. HA HAH!

Aiyyo!  Feel what I feel, see what I see son
Break your neck -- secretly blown, talico style Doc
Trace the sketch -- according to verbal recording hot
Bricks underground detox fuck up farm crops
Yo beautiful!  Cut the cabbage and sell it as pharmeceuticals
I react - the baddest juvenile bite off his cuticles
I'm stone, to the bone, flip poems that roam further
I serve the murder then beef it to ham-burger
* Redman skats, I can't follow it * but I'm only kidding
Knowin god damn well that's hard to spit
Fans call me mix tape arsonist, marvelous, in the hood
Everyday, wanna star?  Check an astrologist
Fuck fuck fuck bitch I'll bust a nut all over that gut
Buck buck buck souflee you lay you then I'm hittin that clutch
You know, papi chulo with the fucked up grammar
So much spanish ass, niggaz think I own Copa Cabana
Shot up Santa, got more tools than, Hanna Barbera, check it
The clues I left was hard for cops to Etch-a-Sketch it
Serial killer that tracks pussy in every borough
Kidnap ya, tie ya down, drug ya, kiss the girls
Klack automatics no matter the pressure the static (KLACK)
I blow you by two miles, cut my lights and hit the hazards
Fatal, duckin from pussy police in LeSables
Biggest thing since getting earrings pierced in your navel
High, Funk Doc, Roni Size keep the herb twistin
And now get the Ampegs real hot like jerk chicken
Ha ha.. alright one more time..
(c'mere baby)

Buck buck buck bitch I'll bust a nut all over that gut
Buck buck buck souflee you lay you then I'm hittin that clutch (8x)

It's where the blacks rub, what, fuck your back up
My dubs be filled with dust when I bust you definitely feel
the rapture..

      Brick City Mashin'!
     </title>
     <lyrics>
      Yo, yo, yo, nigga
* monkey noises in background *
Swinging through the forests of the jungles
* monkey noises in background *
Yo, c'mon, c'mon, yo yo, yo

Yo, look around your seats;
do you see anybody weirder than me?  (me..)
When you find him then I try him, fry him like the gorilla
??billy hanas to hebrew?? how to be an MC  (cee.. cee..)
Sheeyit, take two tokes, I'm dope riding over notes
Overload your periscope, Doc da most
Lock and load with the rock'n'roll star, dozed off
I had him bruised and closed off with one phone call (brring!)
Chickens, mida mida the heater, believe-a I'm a dog
Straight labrador chedda retriever
Let the gorillas out, til the blood is spilling out
Put a slug up in his mouth, then the thug is chicken out (ha ha)
Darkrooms get ignited, bright lights on the mic
So when we battle they can via satellite it
PPP draft pick is massive, athlete Tenactin flow
Doc captain up battin!  Brick City Mashin'!

Turn it up!  (c'mon)  Smoke that shit up!  (c'mon)
Take money money!  (c'mon)  Brick City Mashin'!  (c'mon)
Stolen cars!  (c'mon)  Counterfeit bills!  (c'mon)
Freak that shit out!  (c'mon)  Brick City Mashin'!  (c'mon)
Two for fives!  (c'mon)  Push that shit out!  (c'mon)
Let the monkey out nigga!  (c'mon)  Brick City Mashin'!  (c'mon)
Freak that bitch out!  (c'mon)  Smoke that weed out!  (c'mon)
Freak that hoe out!  (c'mon)  Brick City Mashin'!  (c'mon)

Say I am .. (I am..) some-bo-dy!  (Some-bo-dy)
Say I am .. (I am..) some-bo-dy!  (Some-bo-dy)

Yo, yo-yo, I'm from Da Bricks where the weed go
for two for five dick.. you try this
I promise I'll be at your video, smackin the shit out of you
from crew to hairstylists (lists.. lists..)
Guerilla maneuver on an intruder
I pack like Sinbad pack the house in Aruba (chk-chk)
Blow your brains; yeah, leave the murder scene
Lookin for me is like lookin for Herb at Burger King
_I Get Around_ like 2Pac and Shock G
Fuckin hotties, block the block like Monopoly

      Out the Game
     </title>
     <lyrics>
      [Kanye West]
There's only one girl on my agenda
(You talking bout Brenda?)
Naw I'm talking bout Linda, from last September
Now Linda love lace like Linda love lace
LaFace says she like +Mase+ but she love +Face+
And I know that Linda was a hip-hop-head
And I know that Linda gave Hip-Hop head
But I feel I could convert her
Cuz I ain't here to hurt her mayn
And she was messin wit me when I was still at Burger King
She ain't hop in my bed cuz of the whips and cream
Cuz when I had her in bed I had whip cream
Shakespearian midsummer night dream
I unzip things and pull out big things
They was flashin gr-green, she was like "ch-ching"
Got em, but she know a rreeal nigga when she, spot him
So now she's pickin dresses from Veroraiyn
Scratchin out her maiden and here's my name
Now I'm sittin at the bar wit all my guys
They sayin "Cheers to you for your future years of pain"
Like "Dog you ready to give all this shit up?
The summer's on its way and these hoes doin sit-ups
And when they see the way the G-5 lights lit up
Your gonna wanna have two like John Ritter"
But naww, I bought her a brand new BM
He said "Dog, slow down like Brand Nubian now"

[Consequence]
I just feel the need to purge my soul from the work load
Couldn't watch another nigga get burnt slow
She said her man was busy, always bored her with work load
Never takes her out and falls asleep in his work clothes
She needs some excitement, which leads to this indictment
Believe what you like kid, according to her
When we recorded with her, Linda changed her name to Nicky
Sang along to Darlin Nicky, co-star of my quickies
That foot is so pretty, but I'm sure you recognize
That bra holds titties, those are her titties
Solar's so pretty, but not to rub it in
But that white Russian did make her lonely like the wind
So the over right that's in, on the over night depends
If you take heed the game, and please keep ya name, word

[Kanye West]
Cuz she's just a playa playa
That's playin games wit me

[John Legend]
I can't see myself getting out the game, no time soon
Ooooh, as I continue as I, Ooooh, as I continue as I
Oooh, Oooh
Can't see myself getting out the game, no time soon
Ooooh, as I continue as I, Ooooh, as I continue as I
Oooh, Oooh

      Game (Triple H Theme)
     </title>
     <lyrics>
      Chorus: Ras Kass

I'ma do what I wanna do, when I do it
Ain't nuttin that you can do, when I'm gon' do it
Rap gane recognize the game
and we came to bring the pain
I'ma do what I wanna do, when I do it
Ain't nuttin that you can do, when I'm gon' do it
Rap gane recognize the game
Mystikal, Ras Kass came to bring the pain

[Mystikal]
I got mo' anger than you got in yo' whole body in one arm
and that's a threat to Triple H, three times the harm
That's right, you face to face with a villain
Any has-been, gets harassed and gon' feel the ???
Jump off roofs, land on backs
Stomp on tongues, walk on necks, then I flex
Crackin heads, I can't get no rest
So many enemies, I don't know who to fight next - c'mon!
I'd like to see you try to explain that to my, FIST..
.. why it's in yo' forehead!
And if you really think you got what it takes
to step to the game, GO RIGHT AHEAD!

Chorus

[Ras Kass]
The ghettofabulous Rat Pack, inner city NASDAQ
Young savages, that don't know how to act
Rebels without a gat, that pin you to the mat
Got devils havin flashbacks of When Animals Attack
In a world that's assed out, after I spaz out
Mash til I cash-out, hit my coffin and blast out
(Why?) Cause real riders still do real things
I'm "The Man in the Iron Mask," break steel guillotines
Name is Rass Kass, livin Burger King style
Have it my way, all day, every day
Drink smoke lay, the game and no play
Straight out of L.A, baby - "Get in my bel-ly!"
Protein diet (??) just another Watts riot
"All the ugly people, be quiet!"
The R-A-S K-A-Double-S, yes
Snappin necks for some live effects

Chorus

[Mystikal]
I don't like you.. and when I'm here
and when I walk out (boooo) I see you don't like me too
I've got a physical ability for causin misery
You get maddest when I feed off your negativity
For every boo, I'ma leave a bruise
For every bad gesture, I'ma leave your ass messed up
Watch your mouth, you talkin loud to the hard tester
Back it up, you won't see nuttin unless I LET YA
So you can keep that in mind when I pass by
This is your big chance to say hello to the bad guy
I run with the north side, dirty aren't I..
.. cause I'm three times hellafied!

Chorus

      The Corner
     </title>
     <lyrics>
      [Verse 1: Common]
Memories on corners with the fours &amp; the moors (pronounced foes and moes)
Walk to the store for the rose talking straightforward to
Got uncles that smoke it some put blow up they nose
To cope with they lows the wind is cold &amp; it blows
In they socks &amp; they souls holding they rolls
Corners leave souls opened &amp; closed hoping for more
With nowhere to go rolling in droves
They shoot the wrong way cause they ain't knowing they goal
The streets ain't safe cause they ain't knowing he code
By the fours I was told either focus or fold
Got cousins with flows hope they open some doors
So we can cop clothes &amp; roll in a Rolls
Now I roll in a "Olds" with windows that don't roll
Down the roads where cars get broke in &amp; stole
These are the stories told by Stony &amp; Cottage Grove
The world is cold the block is hot as a stove
On the corners

[Hook: Kanye West]
I wish I could give ya this feeling
I wish I could give ya this feeling
On the corners, robbing, killing, dying
Just to make a living (huh)

[Spoken: The Last Poets]
We underrated, we educated
The corner was our time when times stood still
And gators and snakes gangs and yellow and pink
And colored blue profiles glorifying that

[Verse 2: Common]
Streetlights &amp; deepnights cats trying to eat right
Riding no seat bikes with work to feed hypes
So they can keep sweet Nikes they head &amp; they feet right
Desires of streetlife cars &amp; weed types
It's hard to breath nights days are thief like
The beast roam the streets the police is Greeklike
Game at it's peak we speak &amp; believe hype
Bang in the streets hats cocked left or deep right
Its steep life coming up where sheeplike
Rappers &amp; hoopers we strive to be like
G's with 3 stripes seeds that need light
Cheese &amp; weaves tight needs &amp; thieves strike
The corner where struggle &amp; greed fight
We write songs about wrong cause it's hard to see right
Look to the sky hoping it will bleed light
Reality's and I heard that she bites
The corner

[Hook]

[Spoken: The Last Poets]
The corner was our magic, our music, our politics
Fires raised as tribal dancers and
war cries that broke out on different corners
Power to the people, black power, black is beautiful

[Verse 3: Common]
Black church services, murderers, Arabs serving burger its
Cats with gold permanents move they bags as herbalist
The dirt isn't just fertile its people working &amp; earning this
The curb-getters go where the cash flow &amp; the current is
It's so hot that burn to live the furnace is
Where the money move &amp; the determined live
We talk play lotto &amp; buy german beers
It's so black packed with action that's affirmative
The corners

[Hook]

[Spoken: The Last Poets]
The corner was our Rock of Gibraltar, our Stonehenge
Our Taj Mahal, our monument,
Our testimonial to freedom, to peace and to love
Down on the corner...

      For Da Brothaz

     <lyrics>
      [VERSE 1]
I knew a youngster, met him at 14, a very short scene
Fiendin to make his dreams come true, but see, money was caught mean
Started runnin wild and livin life type of foul, that was my shorty's style
But deep down in heart he was still only a child
He was typin nice at ball, if he had height, y'all
Mighta been 'NBA Today', instead I watched his life fall
Blowin up the spots and poppin them tec glocks
Collectin street props, splittin tops, didn't stop, so many men dropped
Started committin murder after murder
Blasted the last nigga that tried to riff so fast he flipped him like a burger
Slipped and became the victim of his own murder hunger
He got put six feet under by a small shorty that was younger
And this type of street violence today happens too often
It hit me hard as hell to see my dog up in the coffin
People droppin a rose when the casket is closed
Hey yo, that's the name of the game out on the street, that's how it goes
They say: "Live by the trigger, die by the trigger"
It ain't about whose gun is more bigger, nigga
It's bout whose draw is quicker
So to my shorty dog puzzled I'm pledgin
Died at the age of 17, Brooklyn East New York legend

(Tap the bottom of the bottle for the brothers)
Keep it real on the street, money, and look out for one another

[VERSE 2]
Thinkin back when I was chillin with K-Von, but now he's long gone
So I carried on and wrote this song to keep the strong on
Me and black-o way back in childhood when we was wild hoods
Runnin around the neighborhood and up to no good
Started hangin hard out there on the boulevard in stolen cars
Then put behind bars sellin drugs and pullin yards
Then my crimey got locked up for cookin the rock up
Started bouncin uptown to stuck up, my nigga straight blew the block up
Yeah, the blue and whites was on sight runnin with flashlights
On the double a fast life, that's when he seen his last nights
Out on the street runnin from the heat
Then got locked up from (Happy New Year!)
All the way down to (New Year's Eve!)
The two of those in a wardrobe of clothes
Got back on crackin, I let him whip the macks and go lookin for hoes
And then another sad story is headed for me
When i found out another soldier died in the territory
So in memory of my dog I write a lyric
Straight hopin melodies travel from my mind to your spirit
Hear it when I get biz for K-Von, I'm pledgin
Died on 104 Northern Boulevard, Corona, Queens legend

(Tap the bottom of the bottle for the brothers)
Keep it real on the street, money, and look out for one another 3X

(Tap the bottom of the bottle for the brothers)
Keep it real on the street

     <lyrics>
      (The Bubble Bunch)
The Bubble Bunch
(The Bubble Bunch)
The Bubble Bunch
(The Bubble Bunch)
Rockin to the beat	(2x)

Well once upon a time there lived a couple as fat as they could be
So what they did was get together and started a family tree
Well year by year the tree did grow
They might've been fat, but they wasn't slow
And now they're known as the Bubble Bunch
And if they wasn't eatin dinner, they was eatin lunch

(The Bubble Bunch)
The Bubble Bunch
(The Bubble Bunch)
The Bubble Bunch
(The Bubble Bunch)
Rockin to the beat	(2x)

Dig it
Well one day as they ate their lunch
The disco bug bit the Bubble Bunch
I heard one Bubble to another Bubble say
"I've been bit before, but never this way"
So later that night they all got dressed
The Bubble Bunch put on their Sunday best
And three of them decided to go
Where Super Rhymes rocked the disco
Well on my way to the jam to rock the beat
I seen these people comin down the street
Who were lookin like six at first to me
Turned out only to be three
It was (the Bubble Bunch)
The Bubble Bunch
(The Bubble Bunch)
The Bubble Bunch
(The Bubble Bunch)
Rockin to the beat	(2x)

Check it out
Well they paid their money to come inside
And do stuff that they never tried
I had never seen a Bubble free
But these three Bubbles could move to me
Well half the night they danced away
A-bubble-bumpin anybody in the way
But the Bubble Bunch was hungry now
When the food started passin around
They didn't care what people think
They ate the groovy, even if it stink
It was (the Bubble Bunch)
The Bubble Bunch
(The Bubble Bunch)
The Bubble Bunch
(The Bubble Bunch)
Like to do the Freak	(2x)

Well they ate the food till there was no more
And then they headed for the door
But before they left, they had to say
"Now you rock the Bubble Bunch way
You seen us dance, you heard the song
We're here to eat and run, so we have to warn
We're the (Bubble Bunch)"
The Bubble Bunch
(The Bubble Bunch)
The Bubble Bunch
(The Bubble Bunch)
Like to do the Freak	(2x)

The Bubble Bunch
Like things sweet to eat
The Bubble Bunch
Like that burger meat
The Bubble Bunch
A pair of them took up the street
I seen the Bubble Bunch
That like to do the Freak
It was the Bubble
The Bubble
The Bubble
The Bubble
The Bubble Bunch rockin, rockin
The Bubble Bunch rockin to the beat

      I Ain't Bullshittin
     </title>
     <lyrics>
      Fee Fi Foe Fum, cause I came to slam
God damn, its time for you to learn about the man
I peep punks off pursuadin niggaz to pick a place
Huh, on the one here comes to gun to your fuckin face
Cause I catch deep on the streets when I creep
And if by chance I happen fall asleep, don't try ta wake me
Lord for bid I got a grudge on these white folks
For holdin my niggaz and forcin niggaz to sell dope
So I must flush in a rush all this hush hush
I'd rather hear some noise when I go for the bum rush
Strike 1, strike 2, motherfuckin strike 3
Words from that nigga DMG hey you remember G
6-1's how I stand a hundred and sixty pounds
Pretty with my thangs, when I be gettin down
Call me good, call me bad, or call me what you want
Cause any way that it goes I still get what I want
Take out him, take out you, take out your fuckin crew
Pop a soda, pop a brew, and pop a honkey too
Ressurect you can bet that I can break a neck
With my hands in demand but I ain't finished yet
I got the skills to deal when I feel
On the real to real I kill when my lyrics bring dollar bills
I breaks em off, breaks em off somethin proper
Proper dopper somethin like a Burger King Whopper
I ain't bullshittin

(CHORUS)
Uh, yeah, I ain't bullshittin

6-4-5 13 91
Is the number you can call, to reach the nigga with mega balls, huh
Never bullshit just toss me another clip
So I can like fill this shit, and swallow a niggaz lip
I got em sewed, got em sewed, got em sewed up
Tear a niggaz dome up, watch a nigga fold up
DM to the motherfuckin G
Hardcore motherfucker when approached by an MC
Homicidal black man, suicidal trigger man
Menace to society I ain't takin no shorts man
Niggaz call me lunatic, bitches call me ludocris
Fags call me devlish but I'm stickin to a lunatic
As I transfer lyrics bad as cancer
Big staya hatcha I been waitin ta chance ya
Huh, right now I'm rollin like a light
Little penny niggaz gettin bucked
so this nigga'z gettin smack by my presence
I'm in the essence of a nigga
The one who pulls triggas and if he's bigga I pull another trigga
6-8's how he stood full of indo
Heads fat as bricks, enough to shatter your window
2 or 3 slugs to his face, then he hell squirt
7 more shots to the dick, put it in the dirt
Cause in the ghetto I'mma say you never say ya chicken
And DMG is on this here and I ain't bullshittin

(CHORUS)

Nuff rocks out to my nigga Stuff, B Quick, Scarface
And Mad Ron rest in peace my nigga, I love ya man
And I'm out

      Yeah.. yeah..
"Ladies and gentlemen"  "..may I present"
Yeah..
"May I introduce.."
"Four of New York's finest.."
"Give it up for the X-Ecutioners!"

[Large Professor]
Yo
I'm like a country wild western, rhyme style murderer
X-Ecutioners, cuttin things you never heard of
Flip new beats, never once flipped a burger
But I flame-broil, and still remain loyal
On the hip-hop throne, and most kings I been doin it
Rock, Rob, Joe, and Big E is one unit
Supreme force, ever since Main Source, my nigga
Shoulda had yo ass drunk like liqour, in a stuper
Got to stay super, with the Cash Flow
Never bashful, here's what you asked fo'
The best DJ's in the world today
Cuttin up "Rock the Bells" LL Cool J
and many more, Robbie Swift and he raw
Roc Raida, number one chop innovator
Total Eclipse, man you know that he flips
and he diminished the, record like my man Joe Sinister
I'ma lay back and watch 'em bless the track
For the hip-hop world, cuz these brothers don't slack
They always comin with the up-to-par
You can call X-Ecutioners the best by far...

Knowhatmsayin? Yeah..
Knowhatmsayin? Word up..
Yeah...

[Large Professor]
Yo, I take you back to the cave man era
Survival and how to live, on ways I get better
I'm too deep to peek, rock niggaz to sleep
I'm like a four star general, out in the street
Keep my business low, represent Cash Flow
Bustin loose like Chuck Brown to get that dough
Most of y'all could tell, I come from the ghetto
Eight blocks from flushin metal where my family settle
Got Chinese, Korean, Asian
Used to link up with Nas, from Corntop Choice, for female persuasion
Bustin off in the park, that was in the dark
I'm real not fake so please don't pretend to part
I'm lettin it start, the glamour the bucks
Gotta get mine, cuz beef got stamina and guts
Plus the phat beat, plus the rhyme plus the cuts

[cutting up "cut" in background]

[Large P talking]
Yeah, X-Ecutioners rockin the track
Comin through with the hefty scratch
Cuts galore..
Boardin back and forth.. all over the world
Tri-state, every five borough
Word up, these brothers been doin this for a minute
man, gettin busy man, just.. cuttin 'em up man
Choppin 'em, slicin 'em
That's the original essence of hip-hop, knowhatmsayin
just niggaz just gettin busy and shit
Two turntables that's how it started
Two turntables and a microphone
X-Ecutioners, keepin the foundation strong...

      She Spoke Spanish
     </title>
     <lyrics>
      the devil speaks spanish I met her in Denver
she had a pixie cut and a Hepburn strut
she said good was love, happiness and never saying sorry
evil was screwing strangers
after cocktail parties
so here we are at the top of a parking garage
we were eating burger king then she asked for a massage
I pulled her shirt up
admired the olive skin then I gently scratched
her back then ran my finger over her bra strap
she laughed, patted me on the cheek and said thanks for the rub
she spreaded her wings, gave me a wink and said demons don't love
she stepped to the edge and did a swan dive from 6 stories high
she was just a falling angel didnt want to fly
her wings arent broken and the sky isn't falling
I keep my phone on silent
but still look for the light in hopes thats she's calling
I hope that she's calling

where you going madam of the dark damned past
where you going madam how long is this gonna last

2 years later and I'm buckled in a airplane
unshaven heartbroken but the stare is the same
wishing I could tear out my brain
cause that's where the drug is
somewhere in between, my memory and my luggage
I'm standing in the middle of san fran
without a damn plan wishing I had a fucken gun in my hand
I ain't got no pulse I left my heard in north Denver
on the side of Federal on top of a note I never sent her
but here I am, looking for love on Haight Street
but all I see are drugs, questions and answers with maybes
then all of a sudden, my periods turned to commas
and my, paragraphs filled with pauses
my questions marks turned to exclamations points
cause around the corner came my parking garage goddess
her hair was a little longer
but she still had those same big beautiful eyes
she gave me a smile and I felt my 2 year misery die
then it all came back when she spread those 2 wings that I despised
I told her that I loved her
why? was the only question she could ask
I put my hand on her cheek kissed her like Scarlet O'Hara
then watched her wings turn to ash
her horns turned into a halo of smoke
her forked tongue, turned to a spoon
I blinked once I found myself, back in Denver
standing next to her in my living room
I tried to shake off the confusion
I rubbed my eyes, but as they focused she disappeared
I stumbled to my bathroom
and saw her reflection was me, standing in the mirror
all I saw was the devil, standing in the mirror
her reflection was me standing in the mirror
all I saw was the devil, standing in the mirror

where'd you go madam of the dark damned past
who am I madam how long's this gonna last

      Devil's Night!
     </title>
     <lyrics>
      Esham's back in the house for Devil's Night
And I'ma get me some gasoline and burn down the whole scene
Wicked rhymes I be wrestling
You better cover your ass cuz I'ma put ya in Vaseline
Stick 'em, stuck 'em, I fuck 'em up and fuck 'em up good
Freak the funk so I fuck it up like a G should
Burn your house to the ground and watch you all cry
Pour gas all around and hope you all die
The type of arsonist niggas never ever seen
If you saw me on the scene see me smelling like kerosene
I got a magic trick, burn you like a drippy dick
Somebody pass me a Bic on Devil's Night

Watch a nigga get ill like Fire Marshall Bill
Gasoline will spill from here to Louiseville
I got a flame-thrower, arsonist, suicidalist
Burn your mother fucking ass up to a crisp
Strike 'em, struck 'em, burn 'em up, fuck 'em
Fire man come, buck, buck, buck 'em
Cuz I'm a fireman but I got a gas can
Shoot a gas can, and blast your ass man
Shit God damn, I smell smoke
Slit a nigga throat
And fuck the okey doke
Cuz I gotta burn 'em, teach 'em, and learn 'em
Until I get a turn, burn Hollywood burn
The roof, the roof, the roof is on fire
We don't need no water let the mother fucker burn
Burn mother fucker, burn till ya ashes
I burn niggas up when I get hot flashes
I slash his throat
And choke off the gun smoke
Then blaze that ass like a J on Devil's Night

Devil's Night, I need a light so I can blaze up
Police station, wicket Hell raiser
Playing no games, shit's going up in flames
No evidence, no nothing, no names
Return of the dragon, but I'm fire kicking
Your ass'll be crispy like Kentucky Fried Chicken
Cracker, burner, nigga, blacker
I'm a ram shackle
Snap pop crackle
Didn't do a thing, with my gasoline
Until I flame broiled your ass like Burger King
Now you in trouble, watch your skin bubble
Settin' me a fire, get away on the double
Arsonist, watch me just set a fucking blaze
Watch it burn down, cold staring in a daze
Wanna set a fire? I'll be ya tutor
Burn up ya city like the L.A. looters
When ya set a blaze, ya gotta do it right
Watch, somebody gimme a light
On Devil's Night

      Do That There (Young Einstein Hoo-Hoo Mix)
     </title>
     <lyrics>
      [Verse 1]
Ladies and fellas, I was hella bored
So I pedaled hella hard
To a seminar in Zanzibar
Ben &amp; Jerry, tennis star, and Pat Benatar
Ridin' on my handlebars
That I had gaffled from a scrap metal yard
When it fell apart, I got a rental car
With mental Art Lemmon's credit card
Double-parked on the boulevard in front of Cinnabon
Won a tug-of-war with a minotaur
Then I toured the far north on a Portuguese man-o-war
Santa Claus handed me a catalog
The envelope attached on it said that you can have it all
So I got an antelope from Manitoba
Salad bowl, a catapult, a can of soda, paddleboat, a camera phone
And also a Barry Manilow, autographed canteloupe and every episode of "Solid Gold"
The antidote to Babylon and Amazon in an acid-washed can of salt
Then her friend had tagged along, who looked at all on Appolonia

[Chorus]
When I do that damn thing, I do that damn thing
I do that damn thing, I do that there (x2)

[Verse 2]
Here's the story folks
Totally stoned, I rode the slopes of Mount Holyoke
At 40 below, lo and behold
My homey poked too many holes in my snowmobile wheels
Now I'm rollin' on some Boboli's with spokes
Had to pony up the dough to get it all green and gold
Mumble ho, stole an Oreo, a Polaroid, some saltines
An overcoat from Walgreens, some corduroys, some sardines, canola oil
All singin' "row, row, row ya boat"
On and on, with Obi-Wan Kenobi, Shinobi and Kobe Bryant
Pokemon and Pinnochio on the Okeefenokee, Swamp
Europe, Portugal, Tokyo, Borneo and Coney Island
With the Horny Toad Memorial Orchestra with Barry White
Lyrics Born on rhymes, Maury Povich on viola, Berry Gordy on organ &amp; Joe Torre on chimes
Don Corleone gave accordions to Marlboro Marty
When we recorded Jerome &amp; Marcus singin' "oh-wee-oh-wee-oh"

[Chorus x 4]

Whoa...Einstein, do it

(Scratching &amp; instrumentals)

Whoa!...Bring it back, now

[Verse 3]
I met a hermit named Kermit McDermott with a learner's permit
Curb swervin' in a purple Suburban, slurpin an urange sherbert
Eatin a turnip with the words "Dirty Dirty" written in cursive on his Burberry turban
It was curtains
At the circus in Berkley, saw a turtle with a girdle, a squirrel with a curl
And the world's biggest girl, Pearl
Urkel swirled in a circle on a dirty-ass burgundy Murray bike
I had some curry rice, a turkey burger and some curly fries
Tried to return some worthless merchandise to Circuit City
Customer service was certifiably shitty
Courtesy clerk was nervous, kinda twitchy
Had a dry-and-curl perm, reminded me of Lionel Richie
Someone blurted out ("Burrrrrr!")
That's when I turned around, observed
Truck Turner had the burner out and pointed at a surfer
Mr. Furley burst out the beauty purlor in curlers
And a security jersey, thermos full of Wild Turkey

[Chorus til end

[Verse 1 - Consequence]
Uh, we was up in Pop Burger when Pop got murdered
And I admit I never thought that it would pop off further
But when I heard they popped them burners by his grandpa's crib
I needed answers like a teacher who's givin a pop quiz
So once we left the station, where hip hop lives
I went back around the way and popped up at his crib
And his kids said they just came home from Pop Warner
And they pops is in the bathroom, soakin in the sauna
I ran around the corner, to plot his demise
'Cause for crossin the line, pop (*gunshot*), pop (*gunshot*), goes the nine
You got to understand my man Pop had a future
He could've been somebody, they didn't have to shoot ya
But on the same note, when you try to hit the pop charts
You better make sure that toaster's on you like a Pop Tart
'Cause it's not smart to be back on the block
Where they wanna hear your bones snap, crackle and pop

[Chorus - Consequence] - (*scratching of samples*)
My name is Mr. Popularity, fam' I get it poppin, for real
("More than a hustler, I'm the definition of it") - Jay-Z
My name is Mr. Popularity, fam' I get it poppin
("Bitch I'm paid, that's all I got to say") - Lil Wayne
My name is Mr. Popularity, fam' I get it poppin
("No-no-no-no matter what I do, you know I do it to death") - T.I.
My name is Mr. Popularity, fam' I get it poppin
("Because I'm number one, competition is none") - Rakim

[Verse 2 - Consequence]
Uh, uh
The way Pop was married to the game, he might as well have popped the question
'Cause he would pop and make a chain or pop up in a session
And he was such a headache, that they had to pop Excedrin
And treat 'em like a pop star or urban legend
Even heard from his bredren, that he fiend for the spot light
And the paparazzi that comes with the pop life
Then at the stop light, he was heard talkin shit
Like I could show you how to ball or coach pop a bitch
Of course he got a bitch that he would throw in the drop
Who was shaped like a bottle that was filled with soda pop
And when she went to the cops and gave out information
That's how he wound up in general population
Now she the combination of bein the most popular
And most likely to pop at ya, wasn't too popular
It's like a movie that you watch with popcorn
That ends right before Pop returned to top form

[Chorus]

      The Squeeze
     </title>
     <lyrics>
      [Boots Riley]
This brick
Which is gripped by my fingers
Which shoot out from my hand
Which is fastened to my arm
That meets up with my shoulder
That sits well below my head
That surrounds my brain
Which is tied up with thoughts of resentment, fear, and loathing
Because of your using me in your road to wealth and power
Will crash through your picture window and kill you

We gon' put you in the squeeze
We gon' put you in the squeeze

[Boots Riley]
The city is a planet of glass and granite
And it's ran by some masters of mack mechanics
We got schools where the facts are banished
We got scams where your stacks'll vanish
And the hospitals is gon cost you racks so panic
All the gangsters throw your triggers up
All the stoners throw your flickers up
All the drunks throw your liquor up
All the bank tellers stick 'em up
Teach them babies how to grip a buck
When this hits the streets it's thunder with thesis
We'll show you where the beast is
Make sure it deceases
They smolder with speeches
We shoulder the leeches
Call off the polices
This ain't where the thief is
Janitors, work all night like Dracula
Burger flippers grab your spatulas
Managers, get your Acuras
Big bosses guard your sack because
We'll put 'em in the squeeze

Squ-squ-squ-squ-squeeze
Squ-squ-squ-squ
We gon' put you in the squeeze
Squ-squ-squ-squ-squeeze
We gon' put you in the
We gon' put you in the

[Boots Riley]
World poverty has just gone platinum
Unemployment checks need to come with a gat in em
Chains and leather whips
Slave masters still crackin' em
This is where I'm scattin' from
Listen to the battle drum
We all got our shackles on
Ladies shoot your deuce-deuces
Bankers tip your masseuses
Wardens tighten up your nooses
Muthafuckas make noise if you bought your clothes boosted
The earth is composed of space and atoms
And controlled by some pimps without Stacy Adams
But one day they're gon taste the cannon
When the people rise up
And make them muthafuckas face the dragon
Mercenaries show your paychecks
Homeless folks show your blankets
Rich folks throw your banquets
Tell officials what to say next
'Cause they won't be at ease
When we put 'em in the squeeze

Squ-squ-squ-squ
We gon' put you in the squeeze
Squ-squ-squ-squ
We gon' put you in the squeeze
Squ-squ-squ-squ
Yeah, we gon' put you in the squeeze

'Cause they vote with their guns
'Cause they vote with their guns
'Cause they vote with their guns
'Cause they vote with their guns
'Cause they vote with their guns
'Cause they vote with their guns
'Cause they vote with their guns
You know they vote with their guns

      Ghetto Manifesto
     </title>
     <lyrics>
      [* People talking *]

[Boots]
I write my lyrics on parking tickets and summons to the court
I scribbled this on an application for county support
I practice this like a sport
Met Donald Trump and he froze up
Standing on his Bentley yelling "Pimps down, hoes up"
Some tryin' to front off
Break her ass a clump off
We gon' stop the world and make y'all motherfuckers jump off
This is my resume slash resignation
A ransom note with proposed legislation
A fevered ultimatum you should take it verbatim
Cause I got two bangin' pieces and you don't wanna date em'
Flyin' kites for my folks at home
Who takin' tokes alone
We payin' rent on shit they ain't even sposed to own
Narratin' through my verse, agitatin' when ya curse
It's a million motherfuckers just waitin' on the first
Anticipatin' on the worst, wanna weightin' up ya purse
Shook the jobby job down at noon and don't disperse
They wouldn't pay ya ass as far as they can throw you
They think you punkin' but they don't know you
Dissin' turf operata, play with twelve shot berettas
Buy the Burger King workers and we slappin' on ya lettuce
Wrote that in the back of those apartments
A coupon from agricultural departments
When we put down the X-O, we can let the threats go
And start shit, it's the ghetto manifesto

[Chorus x2]
That's what I'm talking about
Make me scream and shout
East, West, North, and South
Gonna turn this party out
Hey, hey

[* People talking *]

[Boots]
Call me bird cause of my legs but my ass don't sing
Got a house arrest anklet but it don't bling bling
The homie with a cell but that shit don't ring
But at lights out bars clang and souls get stang
Now it's the hustlin' sound, trick where they muscle around blacks
Make ya thoughts heavy, drop a joint and make the ground crack
Even renowned historians have found that
The people only bounce back when they pound back
So I take out a spray can and paste the pavement
Defacin' gravements of a sufferin' nation
The files are flagrant and that's the fragrance
I overheard them askin' vagrance for patients
So check the liner notes, I steal my finer quotes
For d-boys tryin' to flow them Gucci's and designer boats
And party liner jokes and all kinds of folks
Who all kind of broke
But bought twenties cause they feel like a lot of smoke
The trees we got lifted by made our feet dangle
So when I say burn one I mean the Star-Spangled
Let's all get high from the income angle
Bump this at the party even if it ain't the single
Here's a slum serenade, on razor blades and grenades
By nannies and maids who be polishin' the suede
You could let the sess blow but let's make the sets grow
Into brigades with the ghetto manifesto

[Chorus x2]

     <lyrics>
      Thanks to my rhyme inventin', I've ascended to the heavens
Did I fail to mention, got more ice than march of penguins?
I'm rich; I make the poor people cry
and I bet it all black because it can't be denied
I'm in debt... but we'll worry about that later
Let me show you the crib, the pool, and the elevator
Ben Grim is my trainer, Ben Sherman is my tailor
diamond encrusted inhaler just in case I get the vapors
Like Mead, I'm makin' paper but I aint spiral bound
as in downward, ain't a coward when I'm schoolin' these clowns
Leave 'em foolish and droolin' like they come down with the downs
Swan divin' like I'm Scrooge into a pool full of pounds

Black plastic; yeah, know you gotta have it
Blaze in the back, my motorcade stops traffic
Black plastic, debts gettin' drastic
Don't care, don't dare me to blast, kid!
Black plastic, know you gotta have it
Blaze in the back, my motorcade stops traffic
Black plastic, debts gettin' drastic
Don't care, don't dare me to blast, kid!

You've seen the heliport, let's go check out my rides
This is a Lamborgini Porsche, it's a one of kind
It's like the batmobile with a McDonald's inside
Sit in the comfort of your garage, inhale a burger and fries
As for clothes, man, you knows I be pimpin' them coats
Dolce and Gabbana, Prada - yeah, I guess that's dope
but, yo, I bought the vatican, I cold own the pope
make him lock and pop with a pope remote
Ben and Jerry's in the kitchen and I mean the two guys
They're makin me a sundae called the mc Surprise
I feed it to my dogs 'cause I'm watchin' my size
then I tell them hippies bolt because I'm fuckin' tonight!
Yeah, I got a harem; welcome to the Virgin Zone
Snuck 'em out of Muslim Heaven like I'm Indiana Jones
Like the Himalayan Hulk, you may think I'm all alone
but I got a bag a bitches and they're beggin to bone!

Black plastic; yeah, know you gotta have it
Blaze in the back, my motorcade stops traffic
Black plastic, debts gettin' drastic
Don't care, don't dare me to blast, kid!
Black plastic, know you gotta have it
Blaze in the back, my motorcade stops traffic
Black plastic, debts gettin' drastic
Don't care, don't dare me to blast, kid!

Roller coaster in the back yard... SHO' NUFF!
Five drops and a cave part... SHO' NUFF!
People starvin' in my home town... SHO' NUFF!
Fuck 'em, I got gold now!
("Show-off!")

Black plastic; yeah, know you gotta have it
Blaze in the back, my motorcade stops traffic
Black plastic, debts gettin' drastic
Don't care, don't dare me to blast kid!
Black plastic, know you gotta have it
Blaze in the back, my motorcade stops traffic
Black plastic, debts gettin' drastic
Don't care, don't dare me to blast kid!

      Down on the Farm
     </title>
     <lyrics>
      [mc chris]
It's mc chris, keep your head low
Stay in your car, you better go home
Cause there's nothin but stars in the corn below
Gettin down on the farm not on the down low
With a shovel and hoe - you sold the land
with a burger and fries from the hot dog stand
Just the sun and a doobie and a farmer's tan
Just an empty old barn and a bored rock band
Chillin at the seminole, fucked up on tobacco
Kids dive in, with Tom to go back home
Life's a vacuum but here - it's wide open
While your busy mopin, I'm in the dark gropin
Down on the farm, motorcycles not mopeds
Dead old ladys, not dreadlocked deadheads
Carburetor on the front lawn a lemonade on the porch
Luke was a farm boy before he used the force
Word up~!!

[mc chris]
You don't know who you are with your dope beats and your fat Porsches
Name is mc chris I prefer back porches
Don't try to file a case cause you got no sources
The law's on my side cause the law I enforces
And your stupid styles, they're just dumb
Tougher than leather? You're not tougher than my gun
Cause we hold our own, out in the Midwest
We don't need Dylan Law, with him we're not impressed
Don't wanna run away like Wendy and Peter Pan
Call it the Bible Belt, I call it Neverland
Sippin down chili dogs outside a Tastee Freeze
Diane sittin on Jacky's lap hands between his knees
Down on the farm, super clean with the gun
Don't cause no harm, just wanna have fun
Drink Pabst, race cars, maybe tip a cow
Down on the farm, I'm down with a hoedown

[Interlude]
Oh mc chris you're so nice
Only twenty-five dollars
You say cowboy I say cow
Brrrrrrrrrrrrah!
If the shit goes down
If the shit goes down (better be ready) {*3X*}

[mc chris]
If the shit goes down, I got my six shooter
Get your ass out of town on my boosted Roto Rooter
More like Norman Bates or like Uncle Jesse or Cooter
Name is mc chris, I don't miss, now pass the buddha
Shootout at sundown, Daisy Duke at my side
Honey says, you don't get shot I'm sure to be your bride
I replied "Hell yeah" as the gun did decide
Sink into the soil as Black Bart grabbed his heart, and, died

[Outro]
There's no way you'll survive {*laughing*}

      Footsteps of Life
     </title>
     <lyrics>
      [Intro: Solomon Childs]
Ok, yeah, yeah, Heroin
Stop fucking saying my name, these niggas know who the fuck I am

[Chorus: Solomon Childs]
These footsteps of life, these footsteps of life
My footsteps of life, you live it the way you wanna live it
You only get to live one life
My footsteps of life, these footsteps of life
These footsteps of life, you live it the way you wanna live it
You only get to live one life

[Solomon Childs]
I look up, and I thank the Lord, that I breathe another day
I saw A-Rod and Barry Bonds, hit homeruns in the same day
A part of history, a bomb barade
I stay in all black like N.W.A.
The East Coast's illest delivery, certified in the pave
Poverty's Hell's Kitchen, the mack 11 equivalent to the lyrics I'm spitting
R.I.P. to Stack Bundles, another hip hop soul is missing
That's why I keep one in the head for them snakes that hissing
Nowadays who do I trust, the marijuana made it too clear
I be 28 this year, and I'm already getting grey hairs
No elevators to slice with the stairs
I'm setting out to make it
Whether how many times I fail, our Messiash's never scared
Just put on more metal gear

[Chorus]

[Solomon Childs]
I was brought up in the era of Rakim
EPMD fisherman hats, my old man at the race tracks
Vials of crack, Dolomite movies versus The Mack
Alligator skin British Knights
Rusty housing pipes, Sergio jeans and tights
Bruce Lee, put your lighters in the air
My real niggas support this
ThunderCats, He-Man, G.I. Joe, Jim
V-I-N, the big cellies, the E-tonics
I wanted my waves to spin like Mike Kelly's
Gold fronts like Kenny Hawk, when I spoke
I wanted niggas to move like I was Inf in Mahoney's Park
Shoot at them rasta boys like I was James Dale
I had my Sugar Ray Leonard, Marvin hat and the cup
From Burger King, WBLS button, my Batman ring
Remember mama cried, when Marvin Gaye died
And they put his pops in handcuffs on the news
Ricky Shroder was the star of Silver Spoons
Hard floors, no carpets in my room
Sunday school, scuffs on my church shoes, flat tops and half moons
Wiffleball bat dues, Pat Benatar grooves, Rest in Peace
To my cousins, Jerry Lynwood and Gumba
Til I see you, shine doula

      Fuck 'Em All
     </title>
     <lyrics>
      [Fabolous] + (Red Cafe)
Go for some food baby
It's Loso man, representin Brooklyn to the motherfuckin death
(What'chu want what'chu say?) Fuck 'em all, motherfuck 'em all
(Overstand what the fuck is goin down) {I'm everywhere!}
Fuck 'em all, motherfuck 'em all {It's the Family}
(I'll be seein y'all) Fuck 'em all, motherfuck 'em all
(It's not an act) Fuck 'em all, motherfuck 'em all
{We see everything!} Fuck 'em all, motherfuck 'em all
{A-M-G} Fuck 'em all, motherfuck 'em all {Trendsettaz}
{Street Fam!} Fuck 'em all, motherfuck 'em all
Fuck 'em all, motherfuck 'em all {whatever, nigga}

[Red Cafe]
You so lame it should be your first name
And I'm so raw I'm Bolivian cocaine
I'm the next of kin to Loso or Kane
I'm disrespectful I'm drivin in both lanes
They pushin my buttons to fuck with my campaign
They know Jermaine is here to take over the game
Now I'ma hear my chain or the Crown Vic chain
The shakedown chain, I clean it in champagne
Then I take aim and I blocka, blocka
Them heavyweight shots from the choppa, choppa
You can Google Cafe, I'm a shotta, shotta
And me no play play when I wrap a, rapper
Since the bubble L-E-X-U-S
I've been swervin and servin the whole U.S.
The Remy and the bourbon be burnin my chest
S.F. we the best, middle finger to the rest

[Fabolous]
I said, fuck 'em all, motherfuck 'em all
Cause I shot so much I smell like the fuckin mall
It's so many guns ain't nowhere to tuck 'em all
And you might dodge one, let me see you duck 'em all
No way, no how, shit I know that
Almost as much as I know O.J.'ll blow trial
I be in the club, Rose, no smile
Few pretty chicks like "Okay can we go now?"
I must be the niggy
I run in your house, snatch your lil' russy and diggy
It's nothin no biggy, and if I hafto I do it myself
I'm feelin like a Puff with no Biggie
Now these joker niggaz OD'n pullin a huge head
So I'ma kill a cow, make sure that the beef's dead
Burger-ass niggaz, I look further past niggaz
And go over the head of Uncle Murda-ass niggaz
I said, fuck 'em all, motherfuck 'em all

     <lyrics>
      [ INTRO ]
Straight off tha streets of muthafuckin Compton
It`s the downest nigga I know
Eazy muthafuckin me
Bout to kick your ass in Ninety-Three

[ CHORUS ]
I creep and I crawl and I creep and I crawl
And I creep and I crawl CREEP CREEP
I said I creep and I crawl and I creep and I crawl
And I creep and I crawl CREEP CREEP

[ VERSE 1 ]
I got my niggas from Gravestreet WATTS
I got my niggas from the CPT
I got my niggas all across the motherfuckin land
Thats down with the E-A-Z-Y  E
Now , early in the mornin I awake
Thinkin about these dead fool`s life that I had to take
Frontin on a true name I peep game at point blank range
FUCK `EM
( muthafuckin right ya`ll )
Back to the set as I jet
Not givin a fuck about the nigga that I went
Thats what he gotta shout for actin like a trick
Now he`s 6 feet and I`m deep in his bitch
Creepin creepin creepin on the marks that be sleepin
Catch you slippin slap the clip in buck `em every weekend
A scandalous lil` nigga with the heart to feel remorse
Dick the niggas corps leave it on his momma`s porch
Don`t give a fuck about shit that`s why I mellow
Or maybe it`s the fact that I`m kin to the devil
A psychopathic nigga thats always quick to fill a
Nigga for a ?? cause I`m a muthafuckin killer
Thriller from Manilla though I`m shown as the average
Try to test your luck and get bucked by a muthafuckin savage

[ CHORUS ]

[ VERSE 2 ]
I got my niggas from Gravestreet WATTS
I got my niggas from the CPT
I got my niggas all across the muthafuckin land
Thats down with the E-A-Z-Y  E
Now , later on that night as I`m rollin
Lookin for a nigga I can Gat and pack a hole in
Stoppin at a light on the latenight
Fire up a Phillie Blunt to get my head right
See some niggas slippin at a burger stand
And in my mind all I`m thinkin is a murder plan
Creepin through the drive through kinda slow
I got my hot beams on the back of the .4
Yo , smokin on chronic with the rag down
Not knowin I`m about to lay their ass down
Reach for them fools make my move
Leaned out my jeep and I creep kinda smooth
With the Gat to the nigga`s dome now he`s sleeps
One shot to the top body flopped on the seat
Peep , I dumped on the lil` skinny passenger
A bitch is screamin in a rage so I blasted her
Smashed and I got about 5 blocks
Before I got stopped by punk ass cops
( shit , fuck `em )
FUCK YOU
* shots rang out *
MUTHAFUCKA

     <lyrics>
      [Intro: Ghostface Killah]
Yeah waasup ya'll Theordore in the house motherfuckeers!
Yeah, Tokyo Tribe 2, Saru santa, Mushasino goonie
Ya'll niggas know how the fuck we get down, it's all real
J-Love in the building, this how we take it

[Ghostface Killah]
I told them up the block niggas to fall back
Dope fiends is dropping, crack heads buggin off Prozack
Whoa, ghetto celeb, shark skin threads
Chicks, we take em like three in the bed
Just agged up something heavy
Some mothers resort to getting rich off Newports
Back and forth to Delaware and VA
Yeah you can't blow, that takes hella years
Base heads taste my shit like "Starks, what the hell's in there?
Usually millionares really rare
Yellow Lamborghini with mustrad suade seats with a bar in there
Even your seeds had a benatar play pen
Your moms is taken, she got shot during number runs
A visa, jeans, buck fifty when ??? come
And a sister gave birth to a killer son
And that be yours nigga, you gon regulate the globe
With your arm and your big world tours

[Chorus: Trife Diesel]
Gun in hand, makin moves in Japan, living off land
Half a kilo in the closet sitting on grams
TU be the grahm cracker, shells like clams
If we don't know you, then we'll blow you, only fucking with fam
Historicle name, Theodore, nigga, we be the Roosevelts
Shoot flames like Godzilla, it makes the soldiers melt
Tokyp Tribe, DJ Muro, king of the den
Crazy yen spending like ?winnin?

[Raekwon]
Diggin daddy, ammo is brolic
Fila sneakers and suade goose, walked in the joint like a paid scholer
Give me all my chedder in fives
Light blue, five fifty by the door, my ho with the nine
How you feeling soldier? Fill up my glass
Threw my hand on his neck, the ring scratched him, that's six, carry smash
Of course he ain't want none, took it like a trooper, this New York
nigga, ?? got cash
Plus his fiends mad loyal
Seen him under the building, and after five, niggas turned the
shooters on hood soil
And the judges love him
He threw and wanted to cuff him, and six months later he slugged him
Had CNN wildin, the Staten Island veteran smiling
See through Johnny ??, stomach still growling
Some Japan nigga, and the fam with him, holding some thing
I think he bought Burger King, he got strings tho

[Chorus]

[Outro: Raekwon]
We gon talk real talk nigga
Straight up, bring that paper out man
That's the only thing we respect nigga, you gotta stay fresh nigga,
and you gotta have
money nigga
Put all that bitch shit to the side right now, and talk about major shit
Word up man, Icewater Inc, a bunch of dalmations man
We gona nigga, uno, my nigga Muro, DJ Muro, rather, Saru hold it down
Lex Leonardo nigga, we gone nigga

      Manic Depressive
     </title>
     <lyrics>
      I'm wakin' up every morning to the same old shit
Landlord straight bitchin' for a nigga to pay the rent
My wife left me two years ago
Now I got a thinkin' problem
And a wine-drinkin' problem
My family turned backs on me, they wouldn't help
I had a psychiatrist but that mothafucka couldn't help
The pressure's in a man and that got me
Damn, I wish my wife would shot me
And take me out of my misery
But yo fuck it! How I got to this point
It ain't no mystery
It started a long time ago when I wouldn't smile
Tell me how you gonna make abused child smile
Watchin' my mom get beated for nathen
I know i'm next so I sit on the bed
Just waitin' for pops to come in and started swingin'
Drunk as a mothafuckin' skunk yellin' and screamin':

"Boy! Didn't I tell your ass to stay out of my business?
Now I kill your ass to sleep!"

This type of shit went on more than three weeks
Moms got beated while I got black eyes and brused cheeks
I lose sleep try to think of a way to make it stop
My only solution: I have to kill pops
My opportunity came and i felt great
Pops left the house and forget to grab his 38
Tonight was the night to make this shit cease
Grabbed the piece cause after tonight there would finally be peace
He came on that night drunk as fuck
lookin' like he been hit by a Mack-truck
I felt a bit nervous and a little scared
But I had to put 38 to his head
He turned and said:
"Ya ain't even got the guts, nigga!"
I said: "I love you daddy!"
And then I pulled the trigga
His body just felt I know was dead
I dropped the gun and then I kissed him on the forehead
My mother started to screamin' and goin' mad
I thought she was glad but I was wrong my mom was sad
Police came and I ended up arrested
This was the genesis of a manic depressive...

Now gettin' back to the present situation
Damn, I'm late for work and my boss is a fuckin' jerk
See, I'm a cook at this little tiny whole in the wall
You may not heard of it, it's called the burger-pit
And when I step in it's the same shit every night
Bustin' my ass 5,50 an hour ain't right
Fuckin' waitress all she does is bitch
Then she sweat up on my ass
Cause I sort of fucked up an order
Hell! I know it was my fault but why she sweat me
Talkin' that punk shit, tellin' me why my wife left me
She know she strike a nerve when my eyes show redness
I stepped to the bitch and said this:

"Look, bitch! You better get the fuck out my goddamn drill
before i slap you to the mothafuckin' floor, bitch!
What the fuck you're talkin' about?"

Oh shit, I know she run to tell the boss
Now he's walkin' over lookin' pissed  and talkin' shit:

"Look here, Joe! You come work everyday late! You're drunk!
I can't take this no more! You cost me money! You fired!"

Fuck! I guess it ain't my day
Just got fired no check and it's friday
Now what the hell I'm gonna do about the fuckin' rent?
I'm leavin' out and I don't have a fuckin' cent
So I went back to my apartment
What did i notice sticked to my door?
An eviction notice, I just looked in the stairs as I cramble it up
Opened and slammed the door  madder than a mothafuck
I started to feelin' like I don't wanna live
Started to grabbin' the phone and shit
Tearin' up my fuckin' crib screamin': "Why me?"
I feel I've been crucified
Come to thinkin' a thought to commitin' a suicide
I grabbed the razorblade as you could figure
A little voice in my head said: "Do it, nigga!"
Right about then I snapped, then it hit me
If I'm gonna go, I'm takin' a couple of people with me
So I wrote a letter to the cops and it said:
"By the time you read this I allready be dead.
I can't take this shit no more, In fact it's time to me to get a little
payback..."
I surrounded my guns with black handles
With a grip of fifth of Jack Daniels
Putted on my armery on tears and take a quick shot
I think I make a landlord my first stop
Got me walkin down the hallway to seddle the score
Cocked the hammer of the nine and knocked on the door:

"So, it's you! yYou got my money? Shit, where's the rent at?"
"Hah hah!"
"What's so funny?"
"This is so funny, mothafucka!"
[Gunshots]

That's what he gets, now he's better off
I drove over to the mailbox to mail the fuckin' letter off
I hopped back to my truck and drove up the street
The end is near and my mission is allmost complete
There it is so I stopped and grabbed my shit
Got out of the truck stepped to the burger pit:

"Hey! What you doin' here? You...I fired you!
What you comin' back here for? Get out of my restaurant..."
[Gunshots, screamin']
"Fuck all you! Yeah, fuck you!"
[Gunshots, screamin']
"It's time to end this shit! Life is a mothafuckin' bitch, ain't it?"
[Gunshot]
"Oh shit! That mothafucka shot himself........"

     <lyrics>
      Well now haha what have we here?

chorus
c-c-c-come with it
get down get down get down 2ce
repeat

It's almost ten o clock see i got a ball of lifted property
so i slid my beenie hat on sloppily
and promenade out to take up a collection
i got game like i read the directions
i 'm wishing that i had an automobile
as i feel the cold wind rush past
but let me state that i am a hustler for real
so you know i got the stolen bus pass
just as the bus pulls up and i step to the rear
this ole lady look like she drank a forty of fear
i see my ole school partner said his brother got popped
pay my respects
can you ring the bell we came to my stop
the street light reflects off the piss on the ground
which reflects off the hamburger sign as it turns round
which reflects off the chrome of the bmw
which reflects off the fact that i am broke
now what the fuck is new
i need loot i sweat the motherfucka
in the tweed suit
and i'm on his ass quicker than a kick from a grease boot
eased up slow and discreet
could tell he was suspicious by the way he slid his feet
didn't wanna fuck up the come on
so i smiled with my eyes  said hey how it's hanging guy
bumped into his shoulders but he passed with no reaction
damn this motherfucka had a hella of andrew jacksons
i'm a thief or pickpocket give a fuck what you call it
used to call em fat cats.
i just call them wallets getting federal  aint just a klepto
master card or visa i'd gladly accept those
sneaky motherfucka with a scam know how to pull it
got a mirror in my pocket but that wont stop no bullets
story just begun but you already know
aint no need to get down shit i'm already low


chorus


My footsteps echo in the darkness
my teeth clenched tight like a fist in the cold sharp mist
i look down and i hear my somach growling
step to burger king to attack it like a shaolin
i never pay for shit that i can get by doing dirt
link up to the girl cashier and start to flirt
all up in her face and her breath was like murder
damn the shit i do for a free hamburger
(girl )"well you got my number you gonna call me tonite"
it depends is them burgers attached to a price
"sorry sorry"
im just kidding i'ma call you write you love letters
"it's all good"
thanks for the burgers emm hook me up with a dr pepper.
(girl)thats cool you want some ice
yeah and some fries will be hella nice
(girl) damn my managers coming play it off okay have a nice day
im up outta here anyway
i use peoples before they use me
cos you could get got by an uzi over an oz
thats what an og told me
gots to find someplace warm and cozy to eat the vittles that i just got
came to an underground parking lot
this place is good as any fuck its all good
walked in found a car hopped itself up on a hood
ate my burger threw back my cola
somebody said hey it was a rented pig i thought it was a roller
"want me to call the cops?"
i dont want them to see me
looked down and saw that i was sitting on a lamboughini
it was rollses ferraris and jags by the dozen
a building door opened
damn it was my cousin
getting offa work dressed up no lie
tux  cummerband and a blackbow tie
i was like hey
"who is it"
me
"oh whats up man i just quit this company
they hella racist and the pay was too low "
i said arite what was up in there though
"a party with rich motherfuckas i dont know the situation
i know they got cabbage owning corporations
ibm chryslers and shit is what they seeing"
just then a light bulb went off in my head
they be thinking all black folks is resembling
gimme your tux and i'll do some pocket swindling
fit the change in the bathroom  and i freeze off my nuts
lets take a short break
while i get into this tux
grunt zipp
alright i'm ready


chorus


Fresh dressed like a million bucks
i be the flyiest muthafucka in an afro and a tux
my arm is at a right angle up silver tray in my hand
may i interest you in some caviar mam
my eyes shoots round the room there and here
noticing the diamonds in the chandelier
background barry manilow copacobana
and a strong ass scent of stoagies from havana
what no place where a brother might been
snobby ole ladies drinking champagne with rich white men
allrite then lets begin this
nights like this is good for business
five minutes in the mix noticed several diffrent cliques
talking  giggling and shit
well one mother fucka gave me twits
and everbody else jacking it throttling
found out later you know coca cola bottling
talking to a black man who he's confused
we looking hella bourgie
ass all tight and seditty
recognzed him as the mayor of my city
who treats young black man like frank nitty
mr coke said to mr mayor "you know we got a process like ice t's hair
we put up the fund for your election campaign
and oh um waiter can you bring the champagne"
a real estate fronts as opportunities arousing
to make some condos out of low income housing
immediately we need some media heat
to say that gangs run the street and then we bring in the police fleet
harrasing me everbody till they  look inebriated
when we bought the land motherfuckas will appreciate it
dont worry about the urban league or jesse jackson
my man that owns marlboros
donated a fat sum
thats when i step back some to contemplate what few know
sat down wrestle with my thoughts like a sumo
aint no one player that could beat this lunancy
aint no hustler on the street could do a whole community
this is how deep shit can get
it reads macaroni on my birth certificate
poontang is my middle name but i cant hang
i'm getting hustled
only knowing half the game
shit how the fuck do i get out of this place.

     <lyrics>
      [Keith]
Yo Jacky, this Keith.
It's the answering machine
I left the keys under the rug
There's some meat up in the closet
If you goin through it out tonight
I'ma run up to Tower Records to get a pizza
aight
Ima come back
yeah

[Dr. Dooom]
Chewin alligator meat live cowsteak
sittin on old newspapers by thekitchen sink
You think im off limits driving a 74 Dodge Plymouth
Up the street with human feet colored apple-green
with spots eatinblueberry Pop Tarts
With the eighth body in my trunk my elbow bleeds with lumps
Walkin from the sanitation dump with rotten skulls
on my waterbed with Miller beer kegs
Blood in my cabinet, ears in my closet
watchin the Raptors play the Houston Rockets
With your arms in the freezer I grab a icicle
puttin fingerprints on my bicycle
Walkin up to have a drink at the club ?there is? three Irish chicks
lookin at me like im sick
Walkin by chin-chins I stole the keys from ya friends
Lookin out ya ?Madrion? hotel window like Elvis Presley
coming down the elevator
Good evening mister excuse me pardon me with body parts
And credit cards walkin down Sunset Boulevard past the red light
I threw a rat with mayonnaise at ya head lights
Four blonde girls screamed and put on their hi-beams
I fake like i'm ?vomiting smoking sick? threw acid on their stomachs
And drove of  with a wig down La Brea listen to a tape by Slayer
Parked in a parking lot behind Burger King
eatin a raw pack of chicken wings
With blood on my fingers I blast a CD by the Staple Singers
The cops told me to turn it down,
they like my shoes from Buster Brown
I went up the block an bought some incense
for the wrong smells in the air conditioner vents
Hey kid need twenty cents havin a cook-out with my neighbor
How ya like the meat flavor mmmm

Chorus:
[Dr. Dooom] we're ya neighbors next door down on the next floor
[Jacky Jasper] sorry bout the noise last night
[Dr. Dooom] we're ya neighbors next door down on the next floor
[Jacky Jasper] hey hey yall got some toilet paper
[Dr. Dooom] we're ya neighbors next door down on the next floor
[Jacky Jasper] don't mind the smell from across the hall
[Dr. Dooom] we're ya neighbors next door down on the next floor
[Jacky Jasper] see ya at twelve midnight comin over

[Jacky Jasper]
Ya shell shocked, cuts a rock mad ?blood? vulcan like Spock
Pull ya ribs out suck ya own cock
Block twenty-five knots laid up outta luck
Cut ya ass open stuff ya like a duck what
?Attraction? recarnation in a slump twenty-five cents
And a german dick pumped up
Shoulda known the killa from the jump junk
In veins impedes the brain hijackin planes
Pull a kotex out of Louis Lane
Explain the sky rain
Cadillacs and dead bitches consort with witches
Twenty-five sistas pussies with blisters we burn'em in rivers
Saviors of pimps and concubines
Have you ever asked yourself will you fuck Marilyn Manson
Or become Charlie Manson Deathwish
Or become Charles Bronson
Take your testicles and your dick for ransom
In a tea jar right next to the cookie jar
With nose and tits smoking a cigar
Beverly Hills superstar Jacky Jasper
Keith a.k.a. Dr. Dooom
Twenty-five dead chicks with an ice pick
Machine guns galactica brooms pay for room two
Into sci-fi we stay fly
Seven heads an ten horns
Side died ripped open eyeball for a subway token
Asshole broken manics in a cave spandex columbo smokin
Panties in liquid pinesol soakin
Selling glass to Dr. Bones, Dr. Dooom ?ass lie on cellphone?
Sportin scuba fins in a limo
Eatin fingers on a hunt
Attached with a pick ass out dick out
Nigga what you want?
[Dr. Dooom]
I want a kotex with whip cream

Chorus:

[Dr. Dooom] we're ya neighbors next door down on the next floor
[Jacky Jasper] sorry bout the noise last night
[Dr. Dooom] we're ya neighbors next door down on the next floor
[Jacky Jasper] hey hey yall got some toilet paper
[Dr. Dooom] we're ya neighbors next door down on the next floor
[Jacky Jasper] don't mind the smell from across the hall
[Dr. Dooom] we're ya neighbors next door down on the next floor
[Jacky Jasper] I'm comin over twelve midnight to borrow some sugar

     </title>
     <lyrics>
      Intro: Mack 10

BLaaaow  Blam 187
Straight murder display from LA to the Bay
Westside,  My nigga Spice 1 aka Fetty Chico
And I'll be Mack 10 aka Mack Manson
What up Spice

Spice 1:

We serving chickens you damn sure can't get at Roscoe's
If you don't want to see no murder then keep your eyes closed
Nigga shake the dice up, roll 'em if it's one or ten
They won't be able to put your ass together again
Leave you in Reece's Pieces, rolling in white cornices
Knocking out teethes, I know where we can get the blackheads cheapest
From my homie down the street on the block
He copping everything from Desert Eagles down to them mini-Glocks
If niggas fuck off the money we raise the murder stats
Me and my nigga Mack 10 committing terrorist acts
You see us bailing don't mumble under your breath
Have the heart to say fuck you so I can put five in your chest nigga
Don't be no punk, I put my Uzi where my mouth is
Yay under couches running out of crack houses
We down and dirty for the birdy thirty-five a sack
Nigga give up the stack it's Fetty Chico and The Mack

Chorus:

Fetty Chico and The Mack
(Murder Murder) Ma-A-Mack 10 shooter, kill a man looter
Fetty Chico And The Mack
(Murder Murder) Open up your mouth, Say Ahh, get
ready for theBlaaoow
Fetty Chico and The Mack
(Murder Murder) Ma-A-Mack 10 shooter, kill a man looter
Fetty Chico And The Mack
(Murder Murder) Open up your mouth, Say Ahh, get
ready for theBlaaoow

Mack 10:

I'm in a murderous mindstate
I'm on so much dope and coke I can't even do my line straight
I smoke that ??? that shit put me in a trance
And since my last LP they start calling me Mack Manson
Now when I come around punks know they're gone
??? my pistol around and fall straight into a coma
So take if you want it that's my number one motto
Hitting licks like the lotto, with a four-five bottle
And assault rifles like Rambo full of ammo
Dump a nigga in his chest and watch him bleed through his flesh
???......   chicken hawking
You kill a nigga, you kill his bitch so she can't talk
So I smoked the bitch and made it simple
I put one in her temple and got horny as a nympho
So with a hard dick and guns, a bad bitch dies
I take my two fingers and then I slowly close her eyes

Chorus

Capping him in his b-brain, with the m-mack t-ten
that's my p-partner we d-d-doing him in
L-l-leave him in the t-trunk
'til his c-crazy kid kicks one in the ch-chamber off
the s-safety
I g-got 'em g-got 'em four extra c-clips
Infra-red b-beam h-hollow tips
D-dirty l-licks m-midnight
M-Mack W-One O and l-laser sights
R-rollin b-blunts smoking to the doobie
In my h-hooptie with my uzi t-talking to me
Telling me thought another lick we can go pull off
He told me keep your mask on don't take your hood off
So me bail into Burger King and me pistol whip the guard
Everybody up on the floor nobody try to make it hard
Another guard was hiding he jumped out and bust at me
So I let him count the bullets in my C-L-I-P
Me hear them sirens ringing and me take off with the stack
Bailing without the stretch it's Fetty Chico and The Mack
187-187-187-187-Blaaaow

      Funky Chickens
     </title>
     <lyrics>
      Yeah nigga
Muthafuckin East Bay Gangster
Back in your muthafuckin face
Rollin in my muthafuckin chicken coupe
Muthafuckin black-on-black caddy
Triple gold D's and shit
Spice muthafuckin one knowmsayin
Straight mobbin

Four chickens in a coop
Make a nigga wanna shoop
Colonel Sanders ain't poppin, droppin
Big fat Baby Huey, ki's they can purchase
Got the whole hood ballin, nigga, fuck churches
Fools in the city turn the fuck up dead
Cos I'm servin more chickens than Foghorn Leg
Feds wanna know where a nigga reside
Cos the nuggets I'm sellin ain't Kentucky Fried
See, I boil it to a certain degree
Sometimes a nigga even sellin quarter pounders with cheese
But it ain't McDonald's or Burger King
Cos muthafuckas goin under gettin caught with hot wings
Ba-da-ba-ba slingin that lleyo
Them feds don't play, hoe
Say no if they ask you if you seen
A young nigga wearin braids slinig birds out a pinto
Smokin indo talkin to my hitman
Put your ass six feet under like quicksand
Get some slugs and a golden shower
Got the muthafuckin cocaine, money and power
Takes a lickin and keeps on tickin, movin, stickin
Fuckin round with the funky chicken

Straight believin in flake from s-p-i
Never gettin high off your own supply

The world was a big fat vagina
Waitin for a nigga like me to get behind her
See, the ballers and the clockers know me so well
Servin my muthafuckin ki's outta cheap motels
Cookin chickens in the kitchen to smoked-out hoes
Collect the shit in my lungs, collect the shit in my nose
See, let a real nigga tell it
I seen niggas swallow they lley, shit it out and still sell it
Keep the hustle goin strong each day
My little homie Larry swallowed five dubs and passed away
Chickens in my drawers collectin them funds
Can't wear boxer shorts, gotta wear dun-dun-dun-dun's
Infrared cos niggas try to jack
See I'm sellin chickens and they gettin chicken scratch
There ain't no match for this killin-ass baller
Call a shot like AT&amp;T and touch all of y'all
I'm countin chickens in my sleep
I used to count sheep
But the chickens give me heap, so catch the tweak
The fuck off, I love it when my stack thicken
Yeah, fuckin round with the funky chicken

Straight believin in flake from s-p-i
Never gettin high off your own supply

Clockers walk around the track pickin doves like bird seed
Mix a little crack with some dirt weed
But I mob in my chicken coupe sittin on triple gold
With just today twenty chicken sold
And niggas love me cos I'm straight 205
And when I stay alive niggas put scrilla out for my life
You put a hit out on me, I put one out on you
You wanna murder who? slugs full of dirt for you
The underground villain, chicken seller
Slingin birds out the trunk, a 95 goodfella
Stayin under from these crooked-ass federalies
And leavin niggas who don't pay me shot up in the alley
Murderin swift and I'm quick up out the scenery
Showin you niggas what my scrilla really mean to me
Cos I'm addicted to the lley slingin chickens
Got me slingin in the shower, two birds every four hours
Watch my ass and I'm on another mail mission
Finna serve some more of that funky chicken

Yeah you know what i'm sayin
Straight mobbin and shit
About 30 ki's in the muthafuckin trunk

Or whatever you're ridin in

Cos muthafuckas'll ride up on you and straight
Shoot you in your muthfafuckin head and drag you up out your shit
They don't give a fuck if you're strapped or not, nigga
This lley game ain't no muthafuckin joke

Straight uncut peruvian flavor
Cookin chickens in the kitchen, nigga, like Shake 'N Bake
Call me chef ???

      Pillow Fulla Scrilla
     </title>
     <lyrics>
      Ya...Ladies I'm Back
Got What You Need...Got You Ready
I Want You To Fluff My Pillow For Me

I'm out wandering, watching while you're looking bored
Rappable powers, half my life is on record
Where the record shopper for anal swap meet cats
Or pulling off the rigid panties from your young auntie
Entrepeneur maneuver, rappers, Inspector Gadget
Pager digits for slim, honies who got the money
Gang flipping magician, you call me David Blaine
Sex first is worth my girl, peep that yellow skirt
Deranged sexual launch, short of a comic
Cookies and milk, honey's pussy felt like warm silk
I bought the coffee maker, listen to Janet Jackson
Food in Tampa, the beach, was it really happening
Sweet G went to Vegas to check the burger joint
Emergency, beautiful sandwich with the handle shit
Calculator work, I got a safe budget
Soft sofa, leather floor, fucking read the warrant
Human afternoon, A/C in the Caravan
The moral street passes shoppers, second hand meet
Partial people, drug induced, reproduced killers
I sleep on a Pillow Fulla Scrilla

"Everynight and everyday, we doing this in many ways"
Sleep on a Pillow Fulla Scrilla
"Everynight and everyday, we doing this in many ways"
Sleep on a Pillow Fulla Scrilla
"Everynight and everyday, we doing this in many ways"
Sleep on a Pillow Fulla Scrilla
"Everynight and everyday, we doing this in many ways"

Partial delivery, DJ with that care package
Actual racket makes attacks, break her backbreaker
Jawbreaker, assign all keys, super sweet tooth
Your lady blew her time with me in the vocal booth
Empty the ATM, switch account to city bank
Bank of Montreal, BLT with pickles, the waitress giggle
The '86, my deal the, was sold to get
Nowadays, I save my memories, I don't forget
I have fun as my alias, my stacks grow
Dark slacks, amtrack, I just relax bro
Stress is for the seagulls, I peep some more finesse
Making lasagna, so people can't afford a dress
My address, attached to a mellow smooth location
When it's time for vacation, ain't no Greyhound Station
I don't like to fly, but hey I do it all the time
Hit on the stewardess, is that a Valour dress

"Everynight and everyday, we doing this in many ways"
Sleep on a Pillow Fulla Scrilla
"Everynight and everyday, we doing this in many ways"
Sleep on a Pillow Fulla Scrilla
"Everynight and everyday, we doing this in many ways"
Sleep on a Pillow Fulla Scrilla
"Everynight and everyday, we doing this in many ways"

Paper enhancer, the quiet man with all the answers
My style is dreamscape, coffee with the cream cake
Casual observer, the underground rapper server
I'm not the hip-hop authority, who's a lead murder suspect
I'm slashing their careers on the torso
Didn't think it was, my nautica is hot also
Middle of the day, send me up some mellow Tony
I got melon and rappers lack if they pistol packing
That's if they forget to call, but won't it happen slowly
She'll come back, she cut off, strut off, end of story
Triple my D-head, welcome to my seargeant's honey
More of some sweet G, from here to Boston dummy
Mammal is durable, expression of executiveness
Buy some land, eat a porno tape and dry my hand
Lottery luck, Lauterdale sipping Gerry Hill
Canada Dry, amateur born looking in the hill
Antoinette suck my sweat plus my clarinet
I go to K-Mart, fuck around and hit the strip
Most exciting got you fingernail biting
For real, I sleep on a Pillow Fulla Scrilla

"Everynight and everyday, we doing this in many ways"
Sleep on a Pillow Fulla Scrilla
"Everynight and everyday, we doing this in many ways"
Sleep on a Pillow Fulla Scrilla
"Everynight and everyday, we doing this in many ways"
Sleep on a Pillow Fulla Scrilla
"Everynight and everyday, we doing this in many ways"

Still on my grind homie
The top pick you right pie homie
Long John weather ducking one time homie
Dealt wit the nine chromie and the 4-4 old
Need something to blast off by remote control let's go!
No burger fool the pimp game is all crunk (LL: like a 70's movie)
Yeah! lil' lady wanna peel that whip
Can't even let you shotgun it wit a heel that thick
Ma! wanted foreplay I showed her the realest
She asked me to go downtown I drove to the village you know!
Half a Belve' baboo gets nada
I repeated myself for it, but you ain't swallow
Breathe! come on boo stop the bullquick
Get your head down, DUCK like you doding bullets AIYOO!
On the low now, remix, it's about to go down ladies

[Chorus]

Would you please rock wit it if you overstand Joe!
[JB:] Get focused man cause whether H2 or Rover man
We do enough AIYOO!
[LL:] Uh! if you focused man
Would you please rock wit it if you overstand, uh!
[JB:] Sing the track now, pause
[QD:] Stop playing man bring it back now

[Verse: LL Cool J]
WHOO! I like the way that sounds
The moaning and the groaning L holding it down
Until the box wouldn't drowned
Yo actresses bouncing off matresses
(QD: look at how fat this is!)
Perfect to practice wit, matter of fact we get
Even more elaborate, flows immaculate
Who can touch us? the Grand Sire getting cheddar wit my
(QD: Young Queen Dutchess) She on fire!
Low puches, eat em up school lunches
I changed the game I got em doing stomach crunches
I rearranged and repaid my lane
Bounced off the guard rail speeding in the rain and
(JB: crashed back in the game) (QD: you know LL flames)
Focused like the +Red Dragon+ on +Hannibal's+ brain
Got them H2 Hummers for the summers no game
I'm rich already I'm just a luggin brigade

[Chorus]
[QD:] Ladies! if you focused man
Would you please rock wit it if you overstand Joe!
[JB:] Get focused man cause whether hoopty or chaffeur man
We do enough AIYOO!
[LL:] Uh! if you focused man
Would you please rock wit it if you overstand, uh!
[JB:] Sing the track now, pause
[QD:] Stop playing man bring it back now

[Verse: Queen Dutchess] (LL Cool J)
When Dutch pull up to the club in the CL snug
Don't worry bout the details love (uh uh)
So much glow they think I'm radioactive
First single drop radio-active (yeah yeah)
Just remember I'm the chick that don't let the track live
Dudes'll hear the flow and forget I'm attractive (never)
Wit LL standing close the Dutch hit it out the park like Sammy Sosa
(Joey go again!)

[Verse: Joe Budden] (LL Cool J)
OG watch me thug you Hepher
(Easy Joe I'll show you how to 'Luv Em Better' ya know)
Jump Off I don't love em at all

Stand out for your chain won't you go untold
Now cheatings alright long as I don't go broke (whoa)
Sing the track now, pause (QD: stop playing man bring it back now)
Friday - I ain't gotta tuck the Eagle
Cause I'm sliding in the back door just ta vinyl
Saturday - we white tee, your man'll get tied up
Later rolling pimp wit some girly and plan to rock
Sunday - Sunday I'm catching flight on a broad
She looked way better the night before it was kinda dark AIYOO!
Sing the track now pause... ok

      Fat Sweaty Betty
     </title>
     <lyrics>
      Why dont you go into the next room and start getting undressed?
What's your pleasure?

(1st Verse- Violent J)
Fat Sweaty Betty, the bitch ain't nothing new
Her moms used to babysat me back when we was two
We'd go to the playground and to the skating rink
And we'd go under the bleachers and she'd let me hit the stank, well uh
She moved across town and never came back
Until the other day, I seen her at the Chicken Shack
She said her name was Betty, I can't believe this shit
The sexy little girl is now a fat sweaty beeitch
She said, "Hey, J, tell me how you've been?"
She had a piece of chicken gizzard stuck to her chin
I told her, "Hold still," and flicked it off her face and said,
"Betty, oh, Betty, what you say we leave this place?"
I took her back to the crib and hit it all night
I let my fingers run across the rip of cellulite
EWW! It was nasty, but I don't let it bother me
She rolled over, fucking knocked the wind out of me
I couldn't breathe, she wouldn't stop, I'm almost dead
I took the lamp, and bust it on her fucking head
We got dressed, I gave her a little kiss goodbye
Fat Sweaty Betty, My fat sweaty pumpkin pie

(Chorus)
Fat Sweaty Betty
Tell me when you're ready (x2)


(2nd Verse- Shaggy2Dope)
Big fat slop of shit people call Betty
Flabs of fat on her back, her neck...sweaty
Boogers running down her nose all over her lips
Can't tell the difference from her titties to her hips
But fuck all that, 'cuz I wanna see the neden
I had to see the cat, the cheesey cheena cheden
Rode my bike to her house, "Hey yo, Betty lemme in
I'm packing some snack cakes, bitch lemme in."
I can hear her coming down the stairs
She opened up the door in her motherfucking underwears
UUGGHH!! Shit, fuck that I'm turning back
But no, the door shut, and shes going for the cake snacks
I said, "Relax, hoe, I'm here, I'm bu-si-ness
you can have the candy, first you gotta wait a bit
I need a favor, come on, Betty, drop them drawls."
AHH!! I knew it, Betty had balls
Oh, no, here comes that ass
&gt;From the top of the dresser with the yokazuna splash
I wish I never came, oh boy do I wish
See Fat Sweaty Betty, the sweaty fat bitch

(Chorus)

(Violent J)
[Fat Sweaty Betty]

[Fat Sweaty Betty]
'Cuz I don't care, I wanna hit the cellulite
I hit the cellulite for a turkey meal delight
[Fat Sweaty Betty]
'Cuz I don't care, you know I'm not afraid to cook
Take off your shoes and let me lick your dirty foot
[Fat Sweaty Betty]
I'll rub you down, I'll rub you down the right way
I hear a buzzer, apple pie's in the microwave
[Fat Sweaty Betty]

[Fat Sweaty Betty]
Ya wanna be with me, ya wanna be with me
Ya want some chilli cheese fries in a ???

You gotta wait, wait 'till the time is right
Let me count the purple bubbles in your cellulite
[Fat Sweaty Betty]
You want some Burger King, you want some Hungry Jack
You want some jelly beans, you want a scooby snack
[Fat Sweaty Betty]
You want some Dominoes, you want a Milky Way
You gotta kick it to the sugar daddy Violent J
[Fat Sweaty Betty]
You want some Lucky Charms, you want some mashed potatoes
Let me hit the skins now and I'll feed you later
[Fat Sweaty Betty]
Because I know, I know you want a Lunchable
Something crunchable, something munchable
[Fat Sweaty Betty]
How 'bout some Taco Bell, how 'bout a pizza slice
How bout some chicken fingers and a bowl of Minute Rice
[Fat Sweaty Betty]

      The Night of the 44
     </title>
     <lyrics>
      [Violent J]
It's one of those nights (another one of those nights!)
The night of the 44
2:30 in the morning, and I'm fully loaded

[Shaggy 2 Dope]
Fully fuckin' loaded bitch!

[Verse - Violent J]
I ran into a gas station, and blew somebody head off they neck (*gunshot*)
I thought it was a dream but then I look and see that I'm a bloody wreck
I can't run to my mama's house, I know that she would never understand
I might as well be a man and finish what the fuck I began
I walked out and started walking away like I ain't seen a fuckin' thing
I went across the street and walked up to the drive-thru window at a Burger King
I knocked on the glass and the kid leaned out to tell me they were closed (*gunshot*)
I blew a hole in his face and his boy was like
"Damn, you got hosed Tommy you got hosed"

[Hook - Shaggy 2 Dope &amp; (Violent J)]
I feel ready to die but it's taking so long
(The world's so wicked, the world's so wrong!)
I just keep movin' on, keep tryin' to stay strong
(The world's so wicked, the world's so wrong!)

[Shaggy 2 Dope]
Shoot they bitch asses!
Thinkin' they ain't about to get shot!
Man fuck that!

[Verse - Violent J]
I started hopping through backyards and ran into a 7-11
Jumped up on the counter, aimed my shit and blew a hole in his melon
I dragged his body in the back and did the same to everybody again
'Til the walls and the windows got so bloody, wasn't nobody comin' in
Police started surrounding the building and I ain't got no hostages
But I fronted like I did, holdin' up some dead kid
I said I'm comin' out, they said "don't bother" and started shootin'
The corpse I'm holding up ain't got no head and they ain't stupid
I ran into the back and started drinkin' Drano bottles
Gettin' high as fuck, I'm going out in a hail of bullets full throttle
I loaded my shit again but I never had a chance to shoot
Somebody blew my head off, all I heard was "Whoooff!"
On the night of the 44..

[Hook - Shaggy 2 Dope &amp; (Violent J)]
I feel ready to die but it's taking so long
(The world's so wicked, the world's so wrong!)
I just keep movin' on, keep tryin' to stay strong
(The world's so wicked, the world's so wrong!)

[Comedian]
Who hasn't gone on a PCP binge
And shot at a couple of cops?
I mean, c'mon!

[Hook - Shaggy 2 Dope &amp; (Violent J)]
I feel ready to die but it's taking so long
(The world's so wicked, the world's so wrong!)
I just keep movin' on, keep tryin' to stay strong
(The world's so wicked, the world's so wrong!)

I feel ready to die but it's taking so long
(The world's so wicked, the world's so wrong!)
I just keep movin' on, keep tryin' to stay strong
(The world's so wicked, the world's so wrong!)

      Pullin Me In
     </title>
     <lyrics>
      Intro:
Y'all know y'all done messed up now right?
Mmmm mmmm, fo' real
[opera singing]
You know, you messed up, I'm not laughing
All y'all beats is soundin the same, y'all rhymin the same
Some of y'all even wearing the same jewelry
And y'all doin the same videos
Shut up, you know you messed up right?
That's why they brought me back in this game
To bring it right back to the essence, mmm hmmm
Oh yeah, and all this kill this, kill that, kill this
Lemme tell you somethin, [what, what]
The real killers, they're standin right over there
Waitin for you to act like a killer, so they can kill you
Yo Sedeck, do me a favor yo
Yo tell everybody on this side of the stage
To just move back a little cuz it's about to get real rowdy
in the front yo, they comin yo
I could never forget the underground hip hop
I'ma dedicate this to everybody that knew me when I was broke
Workin at Burger King, hustlin dime bags on a twelve speed bicycle
All the projects man, youknowwhatimsayin?
Yo

HOOK:
Every time I keep pullin out, y'all keep pullin me in, sin
Kick a little somethin for the New Jerusalem
Let people know you aint forget where you came from, where you came from
Every time I keep pullin out, y'all keep pullin me in, sin
Kick a little somethin for the street DJs
Let people know you aint forget where you came from, where you came from

[Verse 1]
Yo, yo this probably the hardest verse that I ever recite
I'm in the studio with a gun in my neck it's all right
Surrounded by gangsters, I don't know how they got here
But I feel like the Haitian Frank Sinatra, in his young years
New York, on my way to Kennedy airport
L.A., I was told wear colors wherever you walk
Dirt, dirty south, I heard they run up in your house
Shakespeare, no time to jive blast your girl through the blouse
What? MCs, y'all aint nothing but assassins
Every two lines is killin, or incarceration
Murderation, closed casket cremation
Closest you got to prison was seein barson television
But I'ma go long as this thug phenomenon
Pass me a bandanna, two shots from my Mag-num
All of that, to get your attention
Here's a few things I been dyin to mention
Anyone talk about guns, I'ma buy the cartel
Any more beats soundin the same, I'ma put your MPC to cell
Listen, reminiscing on Nas, *It Aint Hard To Tell*
Still feel like somebody's watching me like Rockwell
Talk about diamonds, I'ma kidnap Jacob
Talk about the Fugees, I'ma break up the make up
Put your stake up, I'm about to work my way back to the streets
And y'all wanna bootleg cuz y'all will get Jay-Z

HOOK [variations]
Kick a little something for the projects Clef
Kick a little something for the hip hop fans

[Verse 2]
Hip hop fans, y'all like the woman in my house
No matter how faithful I am, y'all still have your doubts
Talkin bout, is he real in this relationship
Or did he go pop, and on the side get a mistress
My mistress is a guitar, classical like Mozart
Paint murder on the wall just to show y'all some art
And y'all wanna start, and lose body parts
I suggest you start walkin, tell your man stop talking
You know the scenario, the innocent is always the first to go
And Dorothy sings somewhere over the rainbow
Kum Ba Ya, got you trapped in barbed wire
Dope delivery, but I'm the ghost writer
Tall tribes of Juda, deeper than books
Watch what you cook cuz you might get hooked
Man... I miss real MCs
Like Kool G Rap, written in graffiti
Before the plane, I used to take the train
Watch fiends puttin up they vein, moms raisin caine
Able's on the roof, cook like a goose
To calm my nerve, I drink Vodka 180 proof
I'm back in the shack, lay flat on my back
Two choices, sell rap or sell crack
Chose sell rap, but watch my back like I'm sellin crack
Cuz the music industry is the same street format
I sold y'all Nappy Heads, to The Score, to The Carnival
But yet y'all still wanted more
Since Sedeck went back, came off wit a break
I blend so perfect, that you would want it for your mixtape

[beatbox]

HOOK [variations]
Kick a little something for the brothers up north

      M.I.C.
M.I.C.
M.I.C.

[Verse 1]
The Grimm Reaper will reap so don't sleep or make a peep
I'm deep I got a shotty and it pumps like a jeep
As it pump you weep, you're up shits creek
I'm not pumping De La Soul, I'm pumping little creeps
With heaps and heaps of lead, like sheep they're lead
To their deathbed, fed instead of making bread
Then left dead, ripped to shreds, twist and hanging like dreads
I rest heads with bed like Club Med
Get wise, realize that sometimes hypnotize
Emcees who my rhymes and lines that they memorize
Dropkick dipsticks, built like thick sticks and toothpicks
I kick ass, quick and sick like a karate flick
Drop you like a brick you tick
Flame broiled, I either fry the Burger King on mix
Thought you dope but you're shit, you dick I stick
Niggaz up cause I'm a lunatic, my victims are handpicked
You wiped off like lipstick, seasick or homesick
Pretend I'm dead then beat that ass with a broomstick
Say one word and yes your ass I'll chase
That's not gas that's fear in your face
After words no handshake, you soft like cheesecake
Tough like beefsteak but sweet like shortcake
A young star by far that's up to par
No matter who you are, I'll be ready to spar
Cause the mic is a crowbar, my rhymes are solar
Classy like a jaguar, the microphone all-star
Grimm's a die-hard, chill on the boulevard
With my bodyguard, who's big like a saint bernard
It's a war I declare so beware it's unfair
Cause you can't compare gold to silverware

[Chorus]
I destroy!
Get the fuck out my path you interfere with me
Go against me nigga, you don't want no deals with me
I destroy!
Get the fuck out my path you interfere with me
Go against me nigga, you don't want no deals with me
I destroy!
Get the fuck out my path you interfere with me
Go against me nigga, you don't want no deals with me

[Verse 2]
Souls are dead to my demented sentences
Relentless pain, no Novocain I drill like a dentist
Couldn't prevent this, hard like cement tape
Musical weight, leave you hanging like drapes
I crush microphones like they were grapes
On tour, I make a lotta papes
But the words you heard I mend designed and shape
I bent this track, sent this wack apprentice
Ass right back, to the drawing board
He was a joke to the rhyme overlord overlord overlord
So catch the wave like coke, I just float like a surfboard
Stomp in the streets, I tear up clubs
You reach for the mic and I leave you with nubs
I fry brain cells like a bag of chips
When the rapper try to flip or even give me lip
Catch me at my maddest, that's when I write my baddest shit
Then I lock like a pick
On the paper, sick 'em, another victim
For the musical raper, rhyme ripper
Style stripper, nine hipper
Sharp like a nail clipper
I'm bigger than both of the dippers
In very dapper, I'll go deeper than flipper
But when it come to rappers rappers rappers
Huh, y'all just little whipper snappers
So what up, what up, punk shut up!
Or get your jaw broke like Razor Ruddock
Aw shit, I'm at it again
Chasing motherfuckers like I'm Rin Tin Tin
The final chapter no more laughter
As I bomb your ass just like the day after
No nuclear warheads cause instead
All rhymes are launched by the kid who's fed
We're infrared to pinpoint the joint
Or the place of the person I chase face
So walk and don't try to talk
When I snub the stalk
I don't discriminate, Grimm Reaper hates
All emcees who grab the microphone
Yes I dislike them whether they're friend or foe
So yo, I start to throw deadly body blows
Eight punch combos I turn stars into John Does
So if you see me at a show you better G-O
And tiptoe your ass out the fucking door
I film my shows with a handy-cam
Before I go on I sip some brandy and
Sprinkle sweet rhymes like the candyman
And I cripple emcees, I make 'em handyman
I destroy
Get the fuck out my path

      Beautiful Day

     <lyrics>
      {*gunshot*} {Hey Mario} {Easy!}

[Sheek Louch]
D-Block, Vinny... Idol
Let's go

Uhh, uhh, uhh
Hey yo "Walk Witt Me," still got the hawk with me
But tonight I'm not usin it, gun not shootin it
Feel good, it's nice outside
Put your seat back, let's go for a ride
You know where I'm headed first, 3-5-4
Hop out, send somebody to the liquor store
Might even cop a dutch, who got haze?
And I don't even smoke but today I'm ready to blaze
Then I'm headed to Warburton in front of the store
Get some cuffs for my niggaz then, drink some more
Then I gotta go through the hole, you know what I'm sayin?
Plus basketball started and my niggaz is playin
Then I might go to Mount V to check my dawgs
See who's out on the ave, hop out the Nav'
It's just a beautiful day
Sun is out, and I ain't even have to use my AK (HEY!) Listen

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
White tees, white Airs fit beautifully
Benz Coupe, rims spinnin, Jake hatin me
But that's my life ("my life, my life, my life, MY LIFE") my life
In the sunshine ("In the sunshine! .. Everybody loves the sunshine!")

[Sheek Louch]
Uhh, that's enough, niggaz gotta see some bitches now
Next stop, Sheek headed to the Boogie Down
Straight to Fordham, it's 20 to one
I can't wait to bust off and I ain't talkin my gun
I see mami with her kids, still lookin good
Keep your head up mama, even though you still in the hood
Then I'm off to Dykeman &amp; Post, back to Broadway
Dominican mamis, they out there all day
I sign a autograph, make mami laugh
Ask her did she ever take a Crist' bubble bath
I cop a mixtape and cruise through the Boogie Down
I'm on Broadway, GOTTA go to Harlem now
I can't forget my sisters, my queens
You beautiful things - word up
Cause it's a beautiful day
Sun is out, and I ain't even have to use my AK (HEY!) Listen

[Chorus]

[Sheek Louch]
Yeah.. yeah.. yo, uhh
I'm on the Westside of 1-2-5th by Jimbo's
Cop a turkey burger, that's where everybody goes
Or I might cop some Timbs
Pull over, let my mans and them hit my rims
Good lookin here's a hundred, nah I don't want nuttin back
Take that home to your family, don't smoke that black
I see a whole pack of shorties right in front of the mart
Some dark, some redboned, where do I start?
There go Kay Slay right in front of Paulo Express
Still holdin shit down, big crown on his chest
See them Ruff Ryder bikes in the street, liftin it
Everybody chillin, nobody thinkin about killin
Little kids wearin D-Block tees
And all day I ain't even hear a shot, or one cop yell freeze
Heh, it's a beautiful day
Sun is out, and I ain't even have to use my AK (HEY!) Listen

[Chorus]

     <lyrics>
      [10 seconds of instrumental to open]

[DJ Quik]
Yeah.. I wanna take this time to dedicate this song to my city
To my county - fuck it the whole state

Let me take a moment to tell you just what it is
C-A-L-I-F-O-R-N-I-A is the biz
Celebrity down to Cherokee back to the kids
Every level of livin status except for the mid
A paradise situation if that's what you make it
Red and blue equal yellow tape if that's where you take it
Forest fires and earthquakes and manmade lakes
A prescription for chronic tonic to ease your aches
And if you dress right, you can have the best night
Two or three at a time and let the rest fight
The diamonds and red gold might give you a head cold
You freeze like a Jello mold when you hit the light
On Rosecranz you can't make a U-turn
Cross the T flats and try to make new birds or shoot back
It's war and peace with no help from police
Either you restin in peace or tryin to conquer the streets
in California

[Chorus] + (AMG)
Everybody want it but you can't get it
Gangster to the hustler, live to straight win it
It's California mayne (California) it's California mayne (California)
We got movie stars and we got criminals
Boys from the hood and fly saditty hoes
It's California mayne (California) it's California mayne (California)

[DJ Quik]
In Inglewood they come in yellowbone, Compton they come with shots
Carson got the smart ones, Watts got the hots
Glass houses in Linnwood, see how they hop
With the ladies gettin ready in hair and nail shops
In Bellflower Lakewood ladies taste good
It stay hood, visitin but stay if they could
With KDAY bangin out, betray us they stood
by the burger stand tellin stories on the wood
With all these dudes and all these bad broads
and all this good food and all these fast cars
Ain't no wonder why Cali got all these glad stars
Forty dollar shots gettin turned up at the bar
It's the Pacific coast {?} how could they doubt you
I did this track out of town thinkin about you
From Eureka through Ventura down to San Diego
California es en fuego, fuego..

[Chorus]

[AMG]
Leather and wood, I'm good to the plus
Don't even trip, I did the shoes and the bus
76 and Crenshaw was the locale
I used to smoke out in between my vo-cals
Wherever it's cheap, wherever it's Q
Whatever California want us to do
If you in the red and they get you in blue
Represent your concrete keepin it true
And all my girls in the world, I love you all
I never want you to lose, I won't let you fall
But you gotta get better at lovin a nigga, lovin yourself
Instead of steady comin up on the wealth
I been here a while, I know a pretty smile is a trap
To pull a nigga right up out of his cap
But give me 20 minutes I can widen the gap
It's California baby on the left of the map, ah-hah

[Chorus]

      * hidden track; found only by rewinding track #1 from the beginning

{"Green Lantern"}

[Immortal Technique]
The system, can never stop what's been set into motion
Like volcanic eruptions on the floor of the ocean
My purpose is to burst to the surface
Immersed in the smoltering lava from verses
surrounded by, murder mamis not bitches that's worthless
I cut chicken heads off, like hexes and curses, weapons I purchase
make Homeland Security nervous; I run, pockets and purses
like subway searchers robbin masonic temples disguised as churches
I'm busy so I'll leave that one for you to interpret
Three serpents of merchants from military industry murder
The beef is eatin up, like the mad cow in your burger
Fathom the cause of cattle cannibalism
Factory farms, are like a fuckin animal prison
The microcosm of, Adam Smith's capitalism
America's pagan religion given as the mark of the beast to the Christians
A destruction of, Babylon, that's my mission!

[Chorus: Immortal Technique]
Everywhere Tech and them go, the Feds watchin us
Clockin the world through satellites like binoculars
We fight for the release of political hostages
Motherfuckin right soldier, this is the apocalypse!
Everywhere Tech and them go, the Feds watchin us
Clockin the world through satellites like binoculars
We fight for the release of political hostages
Waitin for 2012's burning apocalypse

[Akir]
Yo, sex drugs and murder, webcams and burgers
Check scams and lurkers, test scans to purpose
Sect crams to further, death plans and workers
Get canned you nervous as you step, plan that hurts us
It's demand to be purchased, we can care if you serve us
We programmed to be perfect, frequent handed the serpents
An amazement on purpose, see I'm amazin my earners
But now the tables is turnin, got my hand right on that curtain
Hit the stages and burn it, with these pages I earn this
Can't take it, I'm nervous while fake enemies perp'in
Foul energies worth and, crowds' ears'll be perkin
Take it somethin disturbin and it's hurtin for certain
Yearnin to get my turn in, workin to get a word in
Been in the scene observin while I'm learnin how the system's worked and
Capitalistic merchants tryin to make a million urgent
Constructive revolution confusin how the world's burnin

[Chorus 2X: Akir]
Everywhere I get 'em go, the beast watchin us
Know we got the spot in control, they got binoculars
When we be, out on the road they try to follow us
You never gon' silence this, this is the apocalypse

[Pharoahe Monch]
You have now acquired an old cyrus hybrid, work 'til my third iris
Chip inside my brain projects scriptures onto my eyelids
Celibacy, virtual sex, avoid the virus
Secretive shit that I did will put the city at high risk
The mentalist, the temple that houses the wisdom
It's like, Malcolm X calculus amalgamated algorithms
They say "Pharoahe, teach me about the system"
Nigga boot me in your computer I'll give you acute astigmatism
See through +Windows+, +Word+, Pharoahe's the +Mac+ +Intel+
Bit off the +Apple+, plant seeds, spit crack +Excel+
Lyrical +FireFox+, the verbal +Explorer+
Who metaphors the industry to Sodom and Gomorrah for ya
They profit from water, they'll profit from oxygen
Pharoahe the prophet says that this is the apocalypse
We livin in these last days, use your optics what the topic is
The coppers got binoculars, they'll probably try to knock us cause

[Chorus: Pharoahe Monch, Immortal Technique]
[PM] Everywhere Pharoahe goes, the Feds watchin me
[IT] Satellites observin the fulfillment of the prophecy
[PM] Middle fingers up to the sky with no apologies
[IT] Cause none of you got an apocalypse insurance policy
[PM] Everywhere Pharoahe goes, the Feds watchin me
[IT] Fascism breakin out of the cocoon of democracy
[PM] Middle fingers up to the sky with no apologies
[IT] Iraq was just practice for the urban war philosophy

[Outro: Immortal Technique]
Ha ha ha, AH-hahahahaha!
It's burnin in here, call the Fyre Dept.
Akir, aiyyo Pharoahe
They ain't never gon' find this shit man
Ha ha ha ha, like the weapons of mass destruction

      Hoes and tramps
buts and sluts
bitches tricks
tits and butts

[Verse 1]
Bitches be dreamin for this eight inch demon
and when you hear me screamin, I'm about to free the seamen
wipe myself off on your couch cover
if she talks any trash I'll flash my box cutters
cause I'm rougher than any pimp you've had in your life hoe
I talk soft, walk tall, carry a rifle
kill that bullshit cause if baby gets trifled
I'm lacing the liquor with some piss and some Lysol
roll in a shit-brown Lincoln, eatin' a sticky bun
spot-check the block, big one is gonna gimme some
cause I'm a freak, I like the girls with tattoos
I once got busy in a Burger King drive-thru
I take 'em two at a time, make 'em both say my name
ain't never had three, but best believe that I'm game
and that's the key game, girl I fit words like scrabble
the inner-city cowboy with the thick herds of cattle
cruisin' lake street, gene pool ridin' shotgun
got the flyest tricky's from the Mississippi to Boston
I've got a house full of porn to keep the vibe warm
the doors always open honey, come out of the storm
yo I got daddy's little girls, ones that always stay true
I've got an uptown girl she dyes her pubic hair blue
and I've got a bitch that lives in Kenwood, rich townhouse flavour
she travels on business I'm gettin' down with the neighbors
I got a freak that drives the bus, shows me love with free rides
one hundred hoes in St. Paul but only one from east side
got a Bloomington bitch with a pool in her apartment
rug burns all over from fucking her on the carpet
got the mega-mall hoes, make them all work the food court
yo hit me up with a chicken soft taco and a couple of Newports
got a stripper bitch with body jewels and fake titties
and a hoe that lives in Fargo for when I escape the city

[Hook]
but my favorite one, out of all of 'em, is YOUR girl
I sway the tongue never once have I been forceful
she lays it on like its a job that she loves
who's lips is these? the response is always slugs

[Verse 2]
the Richfield bitches freak the lip gloss and hairspray
downtown women that like to fuck on the staircase
north side chicks, south side chicks, suburban chicks
love to open married women up to the pervertedness
disturbing your relationship, excuse my morals
I'm working with the way I trick 'em out, silly mortals
the words I kick, the sport I play
now what to say when I'm sittin at this buffet with these tasty morsels

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
crusin down the street in my babies mom's caprice
February got the windows cracked, wearin a fleece
hit the bus depot, yo boo you kinda cute
gimme nine and a half weeks and I'll have that freak flippin two
distribute and come across the ????
I know its hard being young girl, let me soothe the pain
I understand you baby, straight up I understand
now lift up your ass so I can pull these fuckin' pants down
the only ones I don't do is those under eighteen
or at least I keep that shit a secret if you know what I mean
I got sluts that love to give head, and I like to watch
the way they move their tongue up and down my...

[Outro]
Motherfucker! I can't believe your sittin down here
recordin' some bullshit like this

(Hey man it's just a song, it's just a song, it's like a joke)

Oh, you wanna be a pimp eh? you better take your ass over
to that neglected girl you got there.

(Why you always trippin' on me in front....)

Motherfucker, you got a kid, how you rhyming about some bullshit like this?

     <lyrics>
      You go ooh and ahh when I jump in my car
People treat me like Kareem Abdul Jabbar
When I'm up to par, no matter who you are
I betcha go hip hop, hurray or hurrah
But the ahhs and ohhs is my kind of news
Pop your tape in, put your car in cruise
I never heard the boos, I never drank booze
Cause I just rock the rhythm, left alone the blues
The L.I. mystique, You sneak to peek
A look and then you know that we're never weak
I know you can't wait, it's never too late
No fear I'm here, and everything is straight
Cycles, cycles, life runs in cycles
New is old, no I'm not no psycho
The monkey on the back makes the best excel
The people in the crowd makes the rock well
The people in the back lets you know who's whack
And those who lack, the odds are stacked
The one who makes the money is white not black
You might not believe it but it's like that
When you come to my show, watch me throw
Down with the other brothers toe to toe
When you make a move, new not used
And watch the bro here just bust a groove
A fat lady soprano, loads my ammo
And hear my jam, with a funky piano
Easy on the wall but hard on the panel
A fool smokes Kools cause he chokes on Camels
In effect, the crew's in check
Run by the posse with the gold around the neck
Homeboys in heat, lookin' for sweet
Ladies in the crowd so they can meet
Somebody to body, makin' a baby
Givin' it to grandma then makin' her crazy
I'm a MC protector, U.S. defector
South African government wrecker
Panther power, you can feel it in my arm
Lookout y'all cause I'm a timebomb
Tickin', tockin', all about rockin'
makin' much dollars while the crazy one's clockin'
The rhythm, to shake the house downy down
Bounce to the ounce, sound so crown
The man, the enemy, Public King, no
All fall to the force of my swing
Like Ali, Frazier, Thriller in Manila
A pinpoint point blank microphone killer am I
No need to lie, got the Flavor Flave

To prove ill win and if not the save
I'll pick up, rack up - put your whole shack up
Just choose to lose the bet, emcee stick up
This is the wiz, but the mike's not his, it's mine
One time let the star shine
And I'm tellin' you, yelling at you you're through
Don't think you're grown because your moustache grew
I'm number one, you know it weighs a ton
And I'll be the burger, you can be the bun, girl
Surroundin', my steady poundin'
Get, get on down to my funky sound
And rock the rhythm rhyme, one time your mind
Rhythm roll, two times control,
the mauler and the caller of your doom
And when I'm ready to leave, you're gonna know I go boom
Three times y'all, rhythm rhyme and rock
Then you'll that the D is on the block
Four times y'all and never ever the whack
It's the hour to the minute, time to blow BLACK

      The Battle
     </title>
     <lyrics>
      [Intro: Truck]
Alright, it's on, this bout is scheduled for one fall
Standing eight count, if you fall, you loss
Both of ya'll rap with honor, don't matter the cost
Alright, now tough mics, and ya'll get it on

[Apocalipps]
You like to talk a lot of shit, but now, I'm makin' you pay
These Mayweather hooks, that I break in your face

[Iron Mic]
Yeah, slow up your pace, punchlines makin' you daze
I go the rounds, to leave you ripped up like paper mache
Nigga you better keep your fist up, and cover you face
Cuz after this, you gettin' stitched up, I'm leavin' you maced

[Apocalipps]
Not nothing, come on fam, why you want me to break your jaw
And have you sippin' meatloaf, through a plastic straw
I suplex you hard, and straight, break your spinal
Apocalipps, I piss CDs and shit out vinyls
Come on, man, stop throwin' on weak blows, I eat those
Get at your people, desert eag' through the peephole
What, you shootin' bricks, nigga, I'm water from the free throw
We had to get it on, the street said we equal

[Iron Mic]
Man, listen, I'd rather fuck you up now, and then respect you later
You gon' have me put your mic on a respirator
When I was young, I got wicked, eight body buddies
But now my arms is so strong, they could body your buddies

[Apocalipps]
Yeah, shots through your belly, hot rocks poppin' your skelli'
The call me inf', I never fake it, I keep it gully
You couldn't touch my mic, if I gave it to you
Half these niggas know I'm not the one to play, do you?

[Iron Mic]
Listen, competition, come an go, my last vic, I bombed him
You couldn't fuck with my style, if I gave you some condoms
My rap's is sick

[Apocalipps]
Yeah, but your jab ain't shit
And I'mma weave right under it, and smash your lip

[Iron Mic]
Oh, you fuckin' daredevil, you must of drunk
You must of drunk a case of Mountain Dew
Or smoked about an ounce or two, thinkin' I won't pound on you
Well fuck you nigga

[Apocalipps]
Well fuck you too
I got a chrome four-four

[Iron Mic]
I got a nine and a rule

[Interlude: Truck]
Wait hold the fuck on, hold the fuck on
Ya'll muthafuckas better stop hittin' below the belt
Next time ya'll nigags hit below the belt
I'm kickin' ya'll the fuck out my ring
I'm takin' a point from Apocalipps, and I'm takin' a fuckin' point from Iron
Mic

[Apocalips]
Man, if you wanna fight, call Oscar De La Hoya
Cuz I handle mine, shootin' up blocks and Ford Explorers

[Iron Mic]
Yeah, but if you wanna talk, talk the prec', to the police
Cuz my semi-auto's def, and retarted for beef

[Apocalipps]
And if you wanna squash beef, cook up a burger with bread
Cuz I'm all squashin' over here duke, is legs and heads

[Iron Mic]
And if you wanna die

[Apocalipps]
Fuck, then that's my kind of talk
Let's run at each other, swingin'

[Iron Mic]
If you fall you loss

[Apocalipps]
Now what's the cost?

[Iron Mic]
For what, for a can of ass whippin' ?
Cuz that's all you gettin', my tongue and my gun spittin'

[Apocalipps]
Between my gums and rugs sippin', hopin' a fight is near
If I was Tyson, I would bite you, but I'm slice your ear

[Iron Mic]
Yeah, and I'mma play Holyfield, beat 'em twice that year

[Apocalipps]
Man, that ice grill is not yours, were'd you cop that stare?

[Iron Mic]
I got that, from my block, where I was raised for years
Laugh now, cry later, nigga, save those tears

[Apocalipps]
Man, I slay your peers, blaze their gear, whatever they wear
And you can name a time or place...

[Iron Mic]
Nigga, whatever I'm there

[Outro: Truck]
I told ya'll, no hittin' below the belt
I told ya'll that shit already
So I'mma end this shit right now
And if ya'll niggas got a problem with that
Come see me, come fuckin' fight me
I'm the king of the ring, come and fight me, muthafucka

I be reppin my city - no one can do it better

Let the top back on the Chevy
Then I crank up the boom
Smellin Issey Miyake
Soon as I step in the room
Hundred thousand in jewels
That's a whole lotta moves
So what's a soldier to do
Standin in his bloody boots
Yea I'm fresh outta boot camp
Ain't gotta food stamp
Counterfeit bills will get you killed
Now where the goons at
It's poppin in Opalocka, floppin dem candy paints
Chrome Daytons, 12 pack of 12s in the seven trey
Still hustle everyday, Dade County be the place
Get murdered for a burger with a nickle-plated burner
Still burnin rubber, bustin rubbers
And these bitches under cover
Tell the truth I ain't a lover
But I fuck her like I love her Boss...

I be reppin my city
I be grippin dem cities
I be flippin dem pennies
Turn em to good and plenty
I be strokin that pussy
I be smokin that kushie
I be flippin dem flounders
They be huntin my bounty
I'm the face of the hood
Every place in the hood
Triple C's in there
Come get a taste of my hood

I'm da captain of the corner
Khaki's and Coronas
Now we gotta show em
So let's patch em up and blow em
Now, blow the dice, shake em
Roll em, don't throw em
Hand clap, where it's at
Nigga show me somethin
Out in Sixy, Opalock, overtime, city buy
You know how we get it Don
Nigga, that's how I bet a thou
Project Poe, I'm the project hoe
That means, everytime I talk, the projects spoke
And we in the same struggle
So the projects know
Gotta million dollar profit
Singin project notes
Just know...
(this what I'm talkin bout right here Poe...)
Wherever I'm at I'm good nigga, hood nigga
First sign of problems, eliminate
Wish a nigga would act
Like he can't have rappers slip out the boroughs
Rosero? with the word, roses hit your mirror?
Cartel representas, center of the war zone
Super cats on the coupe, cover of the whole zone
Catch me in the Source, double XL rated
Next to million dollar Nextel
Workin, ain't trippin other checks now
Super sells, so the pussy's platinum
Back to the basics
You in danger at 16 with the beam
One in the chamber aimed at that 0 7
Got the chopper close by
Head bussa from the Bronx
Rep my city every night
Hundred thousand worth of ice
Tight work, boy that's life work
Crystal clear starin make your eyes hurt
Time for the new breed, Triple C
Custom cars and cycles
Psycho path for my math
Put my hand on the pipe torch

I be reppin my city
I be reppin my block
I be reppin my hood
I be reppin the locks

Welcome to dade county
This the bottom of the beaker
Where the beach is sexy blue
And the cocaine cheaper
High nine five nigga, let me ride
I'm in that dolphin-colored S5
Fire, look at me, I'm
Bouncin with that chick
Got the grill out my left fold
See how now I live
Call me Mr. Stephon
I gotta plush seat from Ingo P
Just know I rep my city thru Miami's E
Yea, I'm Miami's Baby...
Brisco to Opalocka, goon come save me...

      Semi-Automatic Full Rap Metal Jacket
     </title>
     <lyrics>
      Yo, yo...

Chorus: U-God

You can't hack the tactics
Of a semi-automatic full rap fanatic
You can't hack the tactics
Of a semi-automatic full rap fanatic

Verse One: U-God

I make mean lean when I pump my spunk
and hands of chump, of machine gun funk
I bliss, like the fist, of the mantis
Those who oppose get dropped and hit the canvas
With rigormor', I hit you in the core and
pop your legs well in the figure four
You can't stop the force when the blood is coursin
extortion, I'm comin like the headless horseman
Enforcin, tortureous slang from a fortune
Swordsman, throw your rap corpse in coffins
Don't pop glocks at me then cop a plea
A hundred thousand leagues beneath the sea
Deep depths makes rappers salted
Weak rappers asses I cracks my foot, off in
Lay down them lines with them hard hits
And I'm harmin, bombin, with heavy bombardments
Pushin, poetry, like weed by the pounds
Underground railroad RZA track lay it down
I'm hard as pavement, you gaze from amazement
Knock you in the head you wonder where the days went
It's golden bangles, microphone getting strangled
Five-star general, scars you want to angle
Bizarre thriller, war scar for a killer
Sheisty mic device got my hand-piece throbbin
Slice mics precise on down to ice carvings

Chorus 2X

Verse Two: Inspector Deck

Yo
I set the mic in flames, bomb like fighter planes
MC's are shot down long range with sniper aim
No question marks, the session starts with sparks
My flows explodes like hand grenades through your parts
Universal soldier, MO's the holder
globe in both hands, born to be sole controller
Hit the world full blast, my crime pays cash
Slip past these cyphers and the flash from the photograph
Best-seller compose a rough draft
Razor Sharp vocabulary cut glass
Actual facts crowds of thousands collapse
You can't catch my style with bugs and phone taps
Whether rhymes or crimes, I want mines regardless
Hard targets, underground like black markets
Pirates of the darkest water feel the aura
Importer of rough raps that's snuck cross the border
Semi-automatic attack'll spray y'all
Liquid Sword swingin slay all, I'm AWOL

Chorus 1.5X

Verse Three: Street Thug

Wu-Tang be, killin you softly with this song
You won't survive the outcome I bring Def Jams to your eardrums
P.L.O. hits the hardest, regardless
Felony offenders catchin murder one charges
Open cases, got me smoked out in staircases
The dark crusader jackin cats in elevators
I strike back like the Jedi, from N.Y.
It's I illifyin, dope rhyme supplyin
I be all you need to rock these mic devices
Projectile Shaolin style exiles your juvenile freestyle
I'm not your basic street entrepeneuer, crime tour, packs the luger
High pursuit for the CREAM like the bodyguard from Bejing
Inject you with the morphine, then I flee the murder scene
On your facilities, the penalty, DOA
Bomb shell your burrow like Bombay
Opposites attack that's why these thieves stay strapped
As we, travel the glove to put Shaolin on the map
I show loyalty, to my fans fully
Operational raps, that bust through your skully
I'm rated second-to-none I be the top gun
From the land of the Slums spittin blades from my tongue
Park your slug slinger, hit you with the sleeper
Hit-seeker, sounds that be a-ttackin your speaker
Watch me bang the headpiece kid there's no survival
My flow lights up the block like a homicidal
Murder, underground beef for the burger
P.L.O., criminal thoughts you never heard of

      Who Got It?
     </title>
     <lyrics>
      "He who write the songs.." - repeated throughout the intro

[Intro: Inspectah Deck]
Festos (who got it, huh, who got it?)
Underdawgz in the building, U.D.'s (who got it, huh, who got it?)
Streetlife, Size/7, what, Johnny Blaze (who got it, huh, who got it?)
Yeah, what, it's a Shaolin thing y'all, get familiar

[Inspectah Deck]
Truth scholar, you holla up the few dollars
I work it overtime, whether white or blue collar
I prove my honor, cuz I been through the drama
Wu-Chronicles, and I continue the saga
Chart topper, rhyme tough as body armor
When I speak, I hold the globe like a Dhali Llama
The flow is aqua, pa, you swimmin' wit the known piranha
The soul father, get to know my whole persona
Like Shaquana, from Guyana, stay lace in cabana
For papa, she shake her tata's like maracas
Fiend for the block opera, your top sponsor
Got you locked in the scope of the rocket launcher
Stop your offers, cop mine, I drop it monster
Let the rhyme inside your mind like chocolate ganja, it's the worst

[Chorus: sampled singer (Inspectah Deck)]
He, who writes the songs, he, who writes the songs (who got it, huh, who got it?)
He, who writes the songs, he, who writes the songs (who got it, huh, who got it?)
He, who writes the songs, he, who writes the songs (who got it, huh, who got it?)
He, who writes the songs, he, who writes the songs, he..

[Inspectah Deck]
I supply the fire, let your headsets be the bomb
One song, give you pipe dreams like Cheech &amp; Chong
Got dough, cop and go, all else breeze along
Be strong, the high last four weeks long
Get your eat on, she'll hold you til the fever is gone
Got you cold sweatin', and up creepin' til dawn
Wide eyed, off the side, no sleepin' on morn'
O.D.'ing, just the side effects, so, please be warned
Son, I raise your blood pressure like tight jeans and thongs
Guaranteed like throwin' the bomb to Keyshawn
Put your peeps on, I spice it up like Dijon
We be, ease to calm, to the streets we belong
Don't be alarmed, cuz indeed the heat is on
So hot, to touch me, you need tweezers and tongs
If I breathe on the mic, it's left weakened and torn
Til he gone, you'll be leanin' like your sneakers are worn, off the worst

[Chorus]

[Inspectah Deck]
I got the works, like a Burger deluxe, you heard it was us
Got You All in Check like Dirty and Bust'
Play dirty and rough, remain thirsty for bucks
Seein' dollar signs like today's the first of the month
Dunn, it hurts when I touch, flames burst off the verses I bust
Some wanna scuff, but ain't worthy enough
What? I burn you up rookie, just hang your jersey up
I'm on the east side, workin' at a Mercury truck
Seen me servin' up the uncut, that certainly crush
Murderous, first to bust, expert in the clutch
That's my word up, loose links, lurk in the cut
On the re-up, be sure to catch a third degree rush
Here's your beat up, I keep the cut, verbally plush
Keep a burnin' Dutch, heat tucked and burgundy chucks
Won't you turn it up, them wit the girlies, they lust
It's the dopeman, my jams run your thirty and up, it's the worst

[Chorus]

      Freaky Tales
     </title>
     <lyrics>
      These are the tales, the freaky tales
These are the tales that I tell so well
These are the tales, the freaky tales
These are the tales that I tell so well
I met this girl, her name was Joan
She loved the way I rocked on the microphone
When I met Joan, I took her home
She was just like a doggie all on my bone
I met another girl, her name was Ann
All she wanted was to freak with a man
When I met Ann, I shook her hand
We ended up freakin by a garbage can
The next young freak, I met was Red
I took her to my house and she gave me head
She like blowin dicks, is all she said
We jumped in the sheets and we broke my bed
There's another girl, her name is Sherry
You talk about sex and the girl acts scary
I heard she was freakin from my big brother Jerry
Took her to my crib and I popped that cherry
Young and tender, sweet Denise
Get her in the bed and the girl's a beast
I tell you homeboy if you get a piece
She'll only start talkin bout signin a lease
I met a young tender, her name is Lori
An X-Rated movie wouldn't tell her story
She had a twin sister, her name was Lisa
And just like Lori she's a real dick pleaser
My girlfriend's name, was Michelle
Her booty was bigger than the tail on a whale
When I freaked Michelle, I freaked her well
Her pussy got hotter than the flames of Hell
I G'd this girl, her name was Tammi
I didn't wanna do it cause the bitch was ?flantly?
She had a best friend, her name was Janet
I pulled her to the side and I spit that game
I had a lot of freaks, in my lifespan
I freaked one night, with this girl named Pam
The very next day, I saw her with her man
One week passed, and I was in her again
I had an old tender, her name's Jeanine
She was thirty-eight and I was only seventeen
She likes to freak, she's just a fiend
It really didn't matter when I saw her in jeans
I want a big freak, fat and sloppy
I kick on back, and watch the hoe just mop me
Two tons of fun, Big Mad Magenta
A country broad from Alabama
I met this freak, her name was Beth
Her pussy got wet and it smelled like death
I was tired as Hell, I was drippin sweat
but I was all up in her tryin to hold my breath
Bake, and, shake, ups
I met this freak in Vegas
She she said her name was Don-na
She was a ?belt? lil' freak from Chi-na
I said, "I don't pimp, or gigolo
I'm havin so much paper I don't need a hoe
You can break yourself, but you can't break me
You never met a player like Snoop baby"
I knew a dick sucker named Betty Joe
I took her to my house and we did it on the flo'
The girl got freaky let me tell you mo'
She was down on her knees, beggin to blow
She's like another freak, named Renee
You get her all alone and she'll make your day
Like Burger King, she knows the play
and with a freak like Renee you can Have It Your Way
These are the tales, the freaky tales
These are the tales that I tell so well
These are the tales, the freaky tales
These are the tales that I tell so well!

      Look Good to Me
     </title>
     <lyrics>
      [Verse 1: Biz Markie]
This goes out to all the beautiful ladies
18 to 80, blind, crippled or crazy
No matter what nationality or persuasian
Black beauty or Asian or Causasian
No discrimination, I love all the nations
Whether you're Jamaican, Hawaiian or Haitian
( ? ) what a man don't got
And just for that I wanna thank you a lot
Word is bond, y'all look so good
Every time I see ya in my neighborhood
My crew bugs out when they're in the party
Instead of baby got back baby got body
Cause you're all shapes and sizes, look good in jeans
Wanna do me somethin juicy, I know what they mean
I'm not tryin to be nasty, I'm just keepin it real
This goes out to my people who know how I feel

[Chorus: Lil' Kal] + (Biz Markie)
(All you ladies in the nice tight jeans)
You look good to me
(All you ladies in the nice tight skirts)
You look good to me
(All you ladies in the nice tight shorts)
You look good to me
(All you ladies in the nice tight ( ? ))
You look good to me

[Verse 2: Biz Markie]
Now that you kknow what I'm talkin about
I know you will agree without a reasonable doubt
Nothing's like a nice derriere
Looks so good, it's just not fair
Now let me tell you a story about a girl named Judy
Was a 5 in the face, but had a real nice booty
It was so soft and mesmerizin
I met her in Jersey by ( ? )
Oh my goodness, I almost lost my mind
When I saw this hee-haw that was so divine
Now I would usually just kept goin
But it hypnotized me the way she was throwin
I said, "You want a burger and fries with that shake?"
She said, "No, I want shrimp, lobbster and a steak"
Bein Rockefeller is not my duty
The only reason I changed my mind is because..

[Chorus: Lil' Kal]
You look good to me

[Verse 3: Biz Markie]
Tell you what happened to me while I was mindin my biz
I came across a girl by the name of Liz
Puerto Rican or Spanish, almost went frantic
For bein a 10 she was a body mechanic
I was bee-beein on what I was seein
It's like Pocahontas jumped out the TV, an
Hourglass shape that made me go ape
Ask Lil' Mo, she was a 'superwoman' with a cape
She couldn't speak no English, I had Fat Joe with me
So he could tell me what she was sayin about me
She said, "I like papi with big belly"
I said, "Why'd you tell her in Spanish that I want her tele
-phone," now you know it's on
Like hot butter on say what, the popcorn
I had to have that cause she's a cutie
And you know the other reason why is because..

[Chorus: Lil' Kal]
You look good to me
When I walk through the club what do I see
A real fly cutie
You look good to me
You look good to me
That ass is fat
Oh Lord, yeah
You yeah, oh, look good
Oh yeah
Everytime I walk by
I wanna look in your eye
And you look so fly
Oh yeah
When I walk through the club what do I see
A real fly cutie lookin at me
I wanna

      21 Questions
     </title>
     <lyrics>
      [50 Cent - singing]
New York City!
You are now rapping... with 50 Cent
You gotta love it...
I just wanna chill and twist the lye
Catch stunts in my 7-45
You drive me crazy shorty I
Need to see you and feel you next to me
I provide everything you need and I
Like your smile I don't wanna see you cry
Got some questions that I got to ask and I
Hope you can come up with the answers babe

[Nate Dogg ]
Girl... it's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?
Girl... it's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?
Girl...

[50 Cent]
If I fell off tomorrow would you still love me?
If I didn't smell so good would you still hug me?
If I got locked up and sentenced to a quarter century
could I count on you to be there to support me mentally?
If I went back to a hooptie from a Benz
would you poof, and disappear, like some of my friends?
If I was hit and I was hurt would you be by my side?
If it was time to put in work would you be down to ride?
I'd get out and peel a nigga cap, you chill and drive
I'm askin questions to find out how you feel inside
If I ain't rap cause I flipped burgers at Burger King
would you be ashamed to tell your friends you feelin me?
In the bed if I used my tongue, would you like that?
If I wrote you a love letter, would you write back?
Now we can have a lil' drink you know a nightcap
And we could go do what you like, I know you like that

[Nate Dogg]
Girl... it's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?
Girl... it's easy to love me now (Woo!)
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?
Girl...

[50 Cent]
Now would you leave me if your father, found out I was thuggin?
Do you believe me when I tell you, you the one I'm lovin?
Are you mad cause I'm askin you 21 questions?
Are you my soulmate?  Cause if so, girl you're a blessin
Do you trust me enough, to tell me your dreams?
I'm staring at ya trying to figure how you got in them jeans
If I was down would you say things to make me smile?
I treat you how you want to be treated just teach me how
If I was with some other chick and someone happened to see
and when you asked me about it I said it wasn't me
would you believe me, or up and leave me?
How deep is our bond if that's all it takes for you to be gone?
We only humans girl we make mistakes
To make it up I'll do whatever it take
I love you like a fat kid love cake
You know my style, I'll say anything to make you smile

[Nate Dogg]
Girl... it's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?
Girl... it's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?
Girl...

Could you love me in a Bentley?
Could you love me on a bus?
I'll ask 21 questions, and they all about us
Could you love me in a Bentley?
Could you love me on a bus?
I'll ask 21 questions, and they all about us

Nah, I don't be fuckin wit them fat bitches

[Chorus]
Don't be stuck on the things they say

I ain't fuckin wit you anyway
cause I know your a nasty girl (know your a nasty girl)
I ain't never gon discriminate
so let me compliment your eyes (compliment my eyes)
Yeah, It's nothin' but a little baby phat phat

[50]
Them Twinkies got your ass gettin' fat fat
Them cookies got your ass gettin' fat fat
That paint got your ass gettin' fat fat
Bitch you grown, that ain't baby fat fat

In the gym I see your ass up on the stair master
But you got it on level 2, bitch go a little faster
Look girl I ain't gon lie, I'll tell you how I feel
They should hand cuff your big ass to the treadmill
You wanna work out now, cause you know its gettin' hot
And your big ass fin to pop all up out the halter top
Find the right chick, wearing some tight shit, and it's on
See your ass wearing some tight shit, we like "She wrong"

[Chorus]
Don't be stuck on the things they say
now you know it's a nasty world (know it's a nasty world)
I ain't fuckin wit you anyway
cause I know your a nasty girl - You's a nasty girl (know your a nasty girl)
I ain't never gon discriminate
so let me compliment your eyes (compliment my eyes)

[50}

Yeah, It's nothin' but a little baby phat phat
That Burger King dun got your ass fat fat
McDonald's dun got your ass fat fat
That Dominos dun got your ass fat fat
Yeah, It's nothin' but a little baby phat phat

[Lloyd Banks]
I like 'em slim in the waste, curves in the right place
A bitch wit hips, lips, and a nice face
Your appetite'll put a dent up in a nigga salary
You need to stop burnin that weed, and burn a calorie
Your attitude is like you always have gear
You got a pony tail, you ain't always have hair
I just wanna see your Capri's comin' down
Mami we run the town, stay away if you 300 pounds

[Chorus]
Don't be stuck on the things they say
now you know it's a nasty world (know it's a nasty world)
I ain't fuckin wit you anyway
cause I know your a nasty girl - You's a nasty girl (know your a nasty girl)
I ain't never gon discriminate
so let me compliment your eyes

[50]
I'll say something nice about ya eyes, cause you's a big bitch man
Yeah, It's nothin' but a little baby phat phat
Them Entenmann's dun got your ass fat fat
Them Little Debbie's dun got your ass fat fat
These cup cakes dun got your ass fat fat
Yeah, It's nothin' but a little baby phat phat

[Tony Yayo]
I ain't no trick, I ain't have to borrow with my wallet
Freakin' off in your car, on your closet
It ain't nothing wrong wit a big, strong girl
If you can cook your ass off, I'll give you the world
You can be skinny or fat, white or black
Nigga pussy is pussy so, yeah, I'll hit that
I'm a freak, sure I love minage a trois
And I really care lees if you twice my size

[Chorus]
Don't be stuck on the things they say
now you know it's a nasty world ' It's a nasty world
I ain't fuckin wit you anyway
cause I know your a nasty girl - You's a nasty girl
I ain't never gon discriminate, so let me compliment your eyes

[50]
I'm a compliment your eyes

     <lyrics>
      [50 Cent and DJ Whoo Kid talking]

[Hook]
(I'm a soldier) G-UNIT! I started my own gang
(I'm a soldier) G-UNIT!
(I'm a soldier) G-UNIT! I started my own gang
(I'm a soldier) G-UNIT!

[50 Cent]
It's a fact homie, eagles don't fly in flocks
But the eagles I got own sixteen shots
Like beefin', homie I ain't sayin' a word
I'll run up on your punk ass squeezing the bird
Now what New York niggas know about country grammar
Not much, but we know how to bang them hammers
When I pull out that thing, you better break yourself
Or win a trip to ICU, and you can take yourself
If you lucky motherfucker, I'm solider I told ya
Push ya shit back, put my knife through ya six pack
Gat bust, adrenaline rush, blowin' the dust
Five point O, burnin' the cluth, while I'm burnin' the dutch
You thought them other niggas was hot, I'm turnin' it up
This the blueprint, nigga are you learnin' or what
You done told me you respect me, now tell me I'm the nicest
Admit it nigga, I'm a mid-life crisis

[Hook]
(I'm a soldier) G-UNIT! I started my own gang
(I'm a soldier) G-UNIT! (I got the rep of a villian, the weapon concealin')
(I'm a soldier) G-UNIT! I started my own gang
(I'm a soldier) G-UNIT! (full of controversy until I retire my jersey)

[Lloyd Banks]
It's like niggas rate the respect of who gat bigger
Banks been blowin' on purple stuff before that fat nigga
Henny's make dollars, and dollars make death threats
I'm doin' remixes to bulletproof the Lex next
Duck nigga, everdays war
I'm heavy on sports, to my draw like NBA's store
Don't make me send the piece at you
I'll have your man walk around with another rest in peace tattoo
Look creampuff, you can get killed here
Nigga you ain't invincible, even Superman in a wheel chair
I've always been a picky man, but I ain't a flowered star
So I'mma fuck all fifty fans
Look, whether you like it or not, right in ya spot
All in your grill, wearin' the crown, airin' em down
We're in the pound puttin' fare in the clown
I'm running with gangstas, don't make one of em shank ya

[Hook]
(I'm a soldier) G-UNIT! I started my own gang
(I'm a soldier) G-UNIT! (I got the rep of a villian, the weapon concealin')
(I'm a soldier) G-UNIT! I started my own gang
(I'm a soldier) G-UNIT! (full of controversy until I retire my jersey)

[Tony Yayo]
I'mma ride with my rap shit and my body armor
Ride like a Taliban suicide bomber
Four five six feet, I off ya feet
I kill ya with a pillow when you fall asleep
Your records can't sell, your company is buyin' em
Give it up, Burger King is hirin'
You shoulda been a cop, cause you snitch a lot
Talkin' to the jakes, you bound to get shot
I used to watch Big Bird and Scooby Doo
Now I'm choppin' big birds and them bundles too
For that Master P money, that shoppin' spree money
That coke, that dope and that ecstasy money
I'm tryin' to build empires across the state line
So move like vampires, never see me in the daytime
I jump out with a nina and a mack
I have you like Khia, my neck, my back

      Art of War
     </title>
     <lyrics>
      [Lynch Talking]
Art of War nigga, (nigga get in)
The art of war, (I know where he at)
Dedicated to the niggaz
that feel they need to make a living off niggaz
You know, check it out

[Brotha Lynch Hung]
I smell pussy push me, I got a hard dick for killin'
Go head and start shit wid the villain
and get your heart split in a million pieces
You need Jesus I can tell by your releases please
He suck nuts for cheese somebody grease his knees
If you suck nuts for a livin' trust me at least it's these
Lynch haul all up in ya mouth tryna release the steam
And you can rub it on like Visine
And you can dub it all in high speed and watch that bitch nigga scream
And it's nothin' it's no thing I hit the corner
You was lucky and nosy nervous at the corner
I woulda grabbed the body stabbed the body
Then cut the body up like meat and eat 'em ganja leaves
Grab the shotty and get away got away scott clean
So you grab the body I'm in the Mozarotti
Smashin' down I street, all the way from the jail house
Gave it a chance and then I had to bail the hell out
Tight shit but I don't wanna go through that
Sittin' wid my celly like, how did I do that?
See I had to leave 'em blue black, the fool's back
Wid spits like jackler when ya runnin' wid two gats

[Hook: scratching of these lines]
"There's a war going on outside"
"The way of life is the way of death"
"Coming from the thirty six chambers"
(x2)

[Cos]
Seems like I can't mash these days
Cause everybody wanna try to blast C way
Like everybody wanna pass these days
But talk shit about my click we gon' blast these K's
These niggaz gay cats jay cats walkin' cross the street
When we see 'em I'm mashin' like we on a race track
These niggaz way wack, they knew that since way back
That's why when you gave me your shit it got no playback
You niggaz play rap, we be on that real tip
We in the Source mag, we gain the ill tip
And if y'all don't feel this, y'all must not feel shit
Don't buy that nigga album man he a real bitch
This nigga tryna make a dollar off my nig's shit
Don't talk shit to gain fame that's some ill shit
Come wid some real shit, and stop lyin'
Cause you ain't never shot nobody and copped a diamond nigga

Hook

[Brotha Lynch]
Slim love you well slim joke, you been broke
Soon as these Blocc niggaz find out ya M-O that's all she wrote
Cause Blocc niggaz don't fuck wid nut riders we rough riders
Glock 'til they call me the truck driver
I drive bodies down I-5 a, insane you's a damn shame
You don't sell a damn thang to hoes, here's ya damn fame nigga
See you's the same niiga that used to lick on the balls
And hum when I had 'em in ya jaws ask D-E
I wrap CD cases and put 'em on the shelf
I told you motherfuckas I'll gi' you a lil' help
Cause if I really had funk wid you, I wouldn't say shit
Just spray shit, come get you, ya done dizzle
All I gotta do is whistle and here comes the troops
Siccmade niggaz stompin' in steel toe boots
We get paid quicker I know it hurts but it's the truth
Pretty motherfucka I take out ya tooth
Either that or watch the Uzi shake out the roof
How you want it?, like Burger King I'm murderin' and his woman
Trust me, it get tough out here
Motherfuckers could end up in a trunk out here
Can you feel it?

      Hardest Thing is to Stay Alive
     </title>
     <lyrics>
      So many niggas get fucked up in the game.
See thats where they get caught out there.
Cause its not no fuckin game.

When you hear shells comin at cha.
Hot Ones from a shotgun I betta nigga runs faster.
Loose a shoe to get away from a blaster.
Think about that casket you don't wanna be in that shit.
Quick to take his signin you takin everybodies package.
Money over Bitches was a loyal practice.
So you act is if money was no object.
Spinin 5 zues trips for your whole projects.
Epcot center linins for ya bitches roli's for dogs.
Now we in tha mall slayin by his bitches.
Everyday I reminisin how he was livin havin fun.
Cause any day could have led to prison.
Now for a short bid cause if the feds ever caught kid.
It be like 25 years conspiracy.
Another 25 for refeer snatchin up him and his people.
He had his jeep bullet proof with silencers on the desert eagle.
Flipin bricks in Gary Indiana.
He had it locked down from the streets to the slammer.
Only trusted Two things his trigger and his hammer.
Used to be a bumb till had a six month run.
Had a loss suit three G's the case was won.
Met with mexican hoya cop boya.
Bought barber shop named it after c shaday.
There where they found his body.
In a barber chair face down, bullets in his chest.
Sliced apart from the waist down.
Planned to sell his shop stick hoya for everything he got.
Take jewels and his 5.
Then his shoes where cemented.
Drop his body in the tide but hoya was wise.
Even when he ain't around he got ears and eyes.
Gotta stay a step ahead of this game to stay alive.

Chorus (X2)

Always wanted things always wanted cash.
To Live fast get the girls with tha biggest ass.
Fuck her 9 to 5 gotta drive a 5.
Now that I got it the Hardest Thing To Do Is Stay Alive.

Coke head Saundra she grew in Gruwana.
Her man was large and Saundra was his baby mama.
Stayed in drama Fightin with hood rats that he was fucking.
No job all day she did nothing.
They son was 7 years old, she really was a wifee.
First should she would transport blow overnight for a G.
He paid up front they layed up once.
She got pregnant she would dead it.
She had a boy, named her son infinite after his father who did dirt.
She didn't noses after would follow.
Capsules and bottles and crack in the back of his baga.
He let her drive while he drove the burgandy 5.
He often talked about how he wants to murder these guys.
&gt;From off of burger street, had nat workin the street.
Lifestyle richest nigga from how he use to be.
Never thought he'd rock diamonds never took weakness for kindness.
Thats how he gradually grew.
Did a Favor for a favor now the nigga in with the crew.
And Now he live major house in dix hills next to Brook Shields.
With the cook and the maid shit was real.
Saved his first bill, maid, and his bodega.
Good Luck playa sign on the paper taped to the window.
Escaped from a would be kidnapp.
And slept and thought niggas fearless rep until he got wet.
Would had the world in his hands his girl did a scam.
The owners rich is bonin niggas to get rid of her man.
Welcome To The Game Baby.

     <lyrics>
      [Tasha Rosez talking]
Reaching out to di people dem
Ounno seh dem got it
Dem have a clean heart and a firm meditation
Ounno have dat droppa sleep
and dem a get back up later
Yo! Dat wi seh... hold on...
We nah hold back nuh talk
Need a work wi a work
Live and direct pon a new case
A so di ting go, a weh wi seh now...

[Kardinal]
Yo...
Being twenty-one and alive is not an accomplishment
Where I come from yo that's a prerequisite
Eff etiquette check the T-Dot consulate
Any bad talk outta ya mout y'affi cancel it
Niggas wanted to be the king but they couldn't handle it
Too busy tryna sell a ki and a gram for it
Get a little success and they sell out they man for it
Mr. Kardinal's coming now cause the streets are in demand for it
Weh dem man a feel like when the rappers are rappin again
Niggas are tryna get that money and they scrappin again
All dem likkle punks who couldn't flow they trappin again
Or they back to Burger King, or they back inna di pen
(Aiyyo where di Ras yout'?) Light closing again
If you're looking for me I'm three hours from Michigan
Talk like Goliath and black like Michelin
All hands dash dem up! Di Kardi on a mission an we...

[Hook]
Bad like we bad like we bad-eh
Buss up di place Brooklyn to Bagdad-eh
Money deya but we act like we ain't never had it
Ro' pass di handles t'war and let me get hardcore AIYYO!
(A weh dem feel?) AYY - A weh dem feel like?
(A weh ya feel?)Â  EHH - A weh ya feel like?
(A weh dem feel?) CHO - a weh dem feel like?
(A weh ya feel?)Â  EHH - A weh ya feel like?

[Kardinal]
Yo!
Hello out there can anybody hear me?
Here I am here I am! I know my ego will cheer me
I'm five steps from insane one line from your girl
I'm one hit away from destroying the whole world
My names Kardinal listen here, they want you to live in fear
Programming your brain like a PVR listen clear
Some a dem a likkle queer, tell dem fi come outta here
Bad man nuh revere, press record Mr. Engineer!
In the air I will appear, a nuh nuttin yes mi dear
Kardinal is here to see ya jump around nuh shed a tear
Some niggas are brigadiers - they better disappear
I will call the cavalry and come runnin like cavalier
Whatever ya overhear, listen wit a bigga ear
Sometime what ya heard is not di word it ain't nuttin sincere
This is a world premiere shout it from the auctioneer
block - stop talk di ting deh pon cock! And yo we...

[Hook]
Bad like we bad like we bad-eh
Buss up di place Brooklyn to Bagdad-eh
Money deya but we act like we ain't never had it
Ro' pass di handles t'war and let me get hardcore AIYYO!
(A weh dem feel?) AYY - A weh dem feel like?
(A weh ya feel?)Â  EHH - A weh ya feel like?
(A weh dem feel?) CHO - a weh dem feel like?
(A weh ya feel?)Â  EHH - A weh ya feel like?

[repeat]

[Tasha Rosez talking]

     <lyrics>
      [Intro: Soopafly]
Aw yeea, ha ha ha, yeea
Just when you thought it was gonna stop we back in yo' motherfucking ass
Soopafly, Made Men, Dogg Pound Gangstas
D-A-Z, Tray Deee, know what I'm saying?
Kurupt, what's happening?
It that real life gangsta shit
Check it out

[Benzino]
Oh damn, I almost forgot - I gotta go back home and get my two extra clips
For these niggas that be talking shit
See, I don't think these niggas understand me - I pledge allegience...
To kill their army for no reason

[Antonio Twice Thou]
Yeah, they gon feel this Beretta pop, vendettas never stop
I walked with a glock, 17 when the weather drops
You want to flex with this next shit?
Bring your best shit, you fucking with machine gun specialists

[Mr. Gzus]
Nigga, to the death of this, no mask, click it and blast
Bout to blow while your powederkeg escelate, defuse it late when I mash
Throw the thing in the stash, proceed to steppin
To make a motherfucker bleed, succeed with whippin

[Daz Dillinger]
And we blast 'em motherfuckers who be snitchin and tippin

[Chorus: Tray Deee]
We Made Men
Slayin punk niggas just cavemen
Act up, we spray them
Matching since we came in
All the way to get two G's, see the...
Ray Benzino with Mr. Gzus Clockin' C-Notes
All my niggas throw up they shit, like a G though
Bitches get nothin but dick, and the heave-ho
Pack up while I stack my grit, check the steel-o
Pushin weight state to state, like a kilo
We Made Men, motherfuckers

[Soopafly talking]
Aw yeea, and that's how we do it
Y'all don't want none of this
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, here we go

[Mr. Gzus]
See we on some on sound Dogg Pound Gangsta shit
You on some fucking child pranksta shit
If you can't throw thangs you can't hang - raise the fuck up
You might find yourself stuck up, then fucked up

[Benzino]
It's 2 o'clock, I'm around the corner from this niggas crib
Waitin to kill this bitch for some shit he did
I think I hear this nigga comin down the street with his music bangin
It's time to leave his brains hangin

[Antonio Twice Thou]
Word, how y'all niggas tryin to creep up?
Like we won't let the heat bust, 3 fuss make you eat dust
Platinum Cuban around your throat
A Made Men neck tie - that's all she wrote

[Chorus]

[Benzino]
Use your weapon, my lethal left hand.. blows are fatal
I won't betray you, my dog it's time to rearrange you
It's time to ride you, the same niggas who dispise you.. are still breathin
Oh Lord I give you good reason to let my nigga come back to ride one more mission
Like my Soul's given, the situations Hell driven
RSO, murder episode on that 10 starring DPG and the undisputed Made Men!

[Mr. Gzus]
Made Men murdering, brought back veteran
Little black menace, to squeeze on sets again
Slangin and bangin since the age of 10
Bad seed specimen grown into men
Fast cash, fast life livin like that
Plus whip, big gat and on the cage and at the crap that
Undiscript, violent, circle then we run you
A bomb and you wakin and another life is take in

[Antonio Twice Thou]
It's all enough an, stick somethin, spit somethin
Hit somethin, if you see some shit comin.. start gunnin
Fully automatic thunder, shoot me - truth'lly leave 1000 in ya
Have it your way like Burger King, the murder king
Murdering your first string, first to bring the war
Got the 6 saw with tail squeeze it real frequent
Watch ya fuckin mouth when your speakin

[Chorus]

[Kurupt]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, biotch
All my niggas, throw it up now
Say "fuck that shit" (fuck that shit!)
Say "fuck that shit" (fuck that shit!)
Fuck that shit (fuck that shit!)
Say "fuck that shit" (fuck that shit!)
Say "bitch" (bitch!)
Say "fuck that shit" (fuck that shit!)
Say "fuck that shit" (fuck that shit!)
All my ganstas say "fuck that shit" (fuck that shit!)
All my niggas say "fuck that shit" (fuck that shit!)
All my bitches say "fuck that shit" (fuck that shit!)
All the homies say "fuck that shit" (fuck that shit!)

      [Chorus 2X: Shabazz the Disciple]
We on the slow grind, moving as one, but it's four minds
Putting in that work from sound check to showtime
Fuck to po-line, the judge, the p-o's, the whole nine
Go head, go sign, man we about to peel a gold mine

[Shabazz the Disciple]
King of Israel, name rings bells, I'm here to fish scale
Play the hand I'm delt while lands ?holler miss deal?
Bring hell, poisen snow flake on some quick sales
Never plead ball, hit the bar and spen a ?spit pill?
Peep pimp tales, naked flicks with your chick's tail
Gucci smelling lipstick, she love how the dick feels
Keep scales, that shit fails, then we set sail
Empty out the fuckers, hit the coppers than we split sales
Plundered in prison, another soul of a brother has risen
Same gang up, some hang up over a judge's decision
Some niggas yank, spit shanks, others hug a religion
We spit it on a higher plane, agnets hover your vision

[Chours 2X]

[Timbo King]
Yo it's hammer time, from Atalanta all the way to Anaheim
Women stand in line, greet the king, meet the king
Don never hand cuffing hoes, left three daddy roles
Rocking Prada, popping lava, assalama, black pirhanas
Eat food, street dudes, keep tools
Word to your hower, black power, it's the final hour
I went from Martin to Malcolm to recording albums
Soul signing, so melodic, lemon kush, gold chronic
Reap profits, keep profits, keep your hands out my pockets
Yeah, Bo King kicking off, off top
You got to pay off, ain't no shots involved
Cus you don't want the 357 involved

[Hell Razah]
They want beef, we the Burger Kings
Maccabeez, we official, we murder things
Sleep, don't hurt our slang, no gang, we a family tree
From the seeds, to the roots, to the branches and leaves
Label me as a farmer that be growing them trees
Better yet, a carpenter, cus of them hammers I squeeze
Got tools like I'm Home Depot
Hypnotic and that Grey Goose make all them hoes deep throat
Take two pulls to choke shorty, pass the dro
Cross my line, guarenteed you rats is blown
I'm letting you know, you'll never be rich or out poor
I'm a restaurant, raising cooks styles to go

[Chorus 2X]

[Killah Priest]
King Tut rock the Gucci frames, my Uzi rings
Like it's '88, sitting on top of Section 8
Thoro, my step is my borough, spit out brimstone and fire
Apocalypse rap, go with the flow ?novel? through tracks
The marvelous is back, King David waving two gages
Dropping bombs like I'm Arab all over your radars
I'm the poet, the prophet, the preacher, the priest
Songs of survival are sinister, the sin is the streets
Powerful from a gangsta lip, two or three years
I live that Passion of Christ before we all leave here
It's leap year for you rappers who thought you had it
Millenium magic, that's the devil's work ya'll practice
My gat spits at your dragons, clips from a magnum
Call out niggas on the floor, they all crawl out

[Lil Wayne]
Catch me I'm stumbling but no I'm never slipping
I come up out that water with nothing dripping, who fucking with him
I'm the guy they call the Carter the slaughter house
I go hard don't try cause I ride like the Marlins
Come buy I supply you with quarters
And bricks if your money that thick
I ain't running I'm running this bitch, sun on my wrist
I rock that, That rose ? parkay with the crock strap (Damn)
I stroll every single day with the glock strap (Blam)
I'm spittin like Pac back (Wham)
I got that Bentley GT same color as rock crack
Interior stock black, but don't get popped at
I watched half my neighborhood get kept back
The other half sleeping where its best at
Minor set backs, this is grown man talk minor get back
I just had to stress that, talk to 'em B

[Chorus: Baby]
You better know about the game of life
Cause When you hustle you can shine for life
You better know it could happen tonight
When your hood rich living the life
You got the money that could change the frame
And have a bitch just loving your game
You Got a Benz and a brand new Range
With 26's all over them thangs

[Lil Wayne]
Hey, I made a few adjustments, but for better justice
I get that cheddar fuck em.. maybe motherfuck 'em
I'm handing nothing to 'em but a plate of murder
It ain't beef if you can't make a burger... Nigga
I'm on the streets you on the curb
Aint no talking to police 'cause we don't speak the same word
Who that, Tryna take the Carter for a new jack
I'll pistol whip you on your block 'til your blue black
(laugh)... Till your blue black (listen)
Alot of niggas like to touch other cities
But my city like to touch other niggas (yea)
You come down for the Essence and the Mardi Gras
But I got here thats where your partys are
Dont shine too hard, watch behind you god
That chain looking like a sign that say "follow me home"
I'm a desperado from the Hollygrove side
Where alot of folks ride, and a lot of folks died

[Chorus]

[Lil Wayne]
I'm on the corner with my work in the mailbox
One foot out the grave one foot in the jailhouse
I done put my foot in the flow
To fast feet my cash, get my feet out your ass (yea)
I told momma im gone; I'll be back with money
I came back with the throne; she very proud of me
I tell her pray for me; cause everyday for me
Is a struggle to make of it
They got my nigga Big Blake in the state oven
But he gonna eat a nigga plate when he escape from it
Please label me real 'cause I ain't make it here faking
Neither was it vacant; take a nigga bacon (shit)
Break bread or we break heads
Put the pump to your stomach turn your face red
Pump a nigga dome now he a bass head
Hit him one more time like stay dead

[Chorus}

      Don't Crush It
     </title>
     <lyrics>
      Yeah girl
I've been checkin out Big Willie Keith
He been trickin a lot of bills on me
Mmm-hmm!
I think I'ma show him somethin tonight
A lap dance I would say
Yeah, that's what I'ma do
Yeahhhh..

[Kool Keith]
I'm like a freak from Hunts Point, the bronze and the gold
Wear my drawers in tight mode, naked with no coat
Walkin around, I see youse about to lose her
That honey with white boots, and hair like Medusa
Brown-skin fine, I drink her body like wine
and throw the wax on it, and watch two cheeks shine
I drunk a forty, I'm up in here feelin naughty
I like the go-go girl, go 'head work it shorty
I got no time to trick, on the average girl
I'm in paradise, caught up, in the booty world
And for you regular honies, tryin to play fly
I ain't no Chemical no Bank in your human eye
I like my spot, everybody's butt naked
Pump with G-strings, watchin hot momma shake it
I got my beer, viewin from the back rear
Yo brotherman, pass it right over here
I got to ease off the stress, like a eight to five
Keepin it real vexed, them panties wanna get live
Change the pace up, yo Jimmy turn the bass up
Yea yeah yeahhhh

Chorus: Kool Keith + girl (repeat 2X)

Yo baby (whassup?)
Don't crush it when you sit upon it
(Yo baby) whassup?
(Don't rush it when I sit upon it)

[Kool Keith]
I see you scopin me, the fourth time you cut your eye
Left the brother to catch wreck, then tell the man goodbye
I'm next on the menu, runnin up and in you
with seven rubbers on me, don't try to discontinue
We gots to bump and grind, crank up the R. Kelly
Delicious kickin, no leather like I'm Fonzarelli
I order two drinks to think, while you show me pink
Summer Eve breeze and WOO when it don't stink
I'm in the mix, like Funky-master Flex
I'm shootin gizm, then after you can pick up next
I watch you shake it, like palm trees in California
Now you a lady, mature and I'm rubbin on ya
I got my Phantom mask, I'm on the dolo
I slipped in my Tipton, bonin sweetie look like Yo-Yo
She had a good time, knees bent in the chair
She said, "Get wild - I like it when you pull my hair"
I gave her cream, and rubbed it on her black boots
I see a packed house in different color body suits
I'm in the front row, chillin on the down low
Checkin her dogstyle, she's ??
I'm from the back kid, smooth with tons of grease
Denver and Texas, and Cali on back to East
She hittin switches, and watch she make it lowride
Zoot, zoot, zzzzzzzt

Chorus 1.5X

[Kool Keith]
It's three o'clock, the morning shift's about to come
Watchin Goldie lapdance, that grey hiney ain't no slum
I gets my workout, my slickest hand from every angle
She's on the job right, cutiepie sippin Tango
I gotta peel for real, a hundred dollar bill
I'm comin straight up, and not for a breakfast meal
This ain't no Burger King, this ain't no White Castle
Not like some ugly girls in Bentleys tryin to give a hassle
I like the slot machine, bustin nuts mean
Slippery wet lubrication like Valvoline
I'm pullin nylon, yo dead up G, to the side
Feelin soft flesh, I'm hard, I'ma let her ride
Jump up and down, get live like House of Pain
Leavin em so wet, the silk with a tan stain
I reach a climax, she's happy with her orgasms
Go on girl!

      Apples
     </title>
     <lyrics>
      [Kool Keith]
You know women are like
You know women are like apples
They're like fruit when you go to the store
I dibble and dabble, dibble and dabble, dibble and dabble, dibble and dabble
Pick out the apples
I dibble and dabble, dibble and dabble, dibble and dabble
Pick out the apples, apples, apples

I did the game already before they made Parker Brothers
You bought the Donny Pizo, ruin the game
I put the first man on the moon, presented new in the game
In the back war to watch
When the mink got stained I tricked the money off
With the ladies for the breast surgery, gave the woman a brain
Right beside your toilet, my rubber remain
I reduce the lower rate, and eatin rate, but my status gain
Four tiny pieces in a bucket
Hit the In-N-Out Burger, get in the carpool lane
Beyond the average dust smoker, '73 cats put down the cocaine

[Nancy Des Rose]
Lyrical fiction is what they call it, poetical phrase that you inhale
Steadily lettin the words flow to your brain
Ladies not being true to their game
Liars, cheaters and deceivers blindfoldin women, prayin on weak players
Girls hatin the next level vibe like I'm from some other tribe
Too blessed to be stress ladies and gents
I'm comin at you like a glass of milk with Oreos, I need a sweettooth
I know you just wanna say my name, lady fame
Droppin gold metaphors while you do your chores
As I step up I made you sweat so hot better lick your fingers before you touch
Master telepathic energy tantalizing your, lymphatic sensory
Unlike any other female I'm no chick
I don't walk around thinkin I got a dick, the strictly fancy, lady
I get nasty instead of being crafty
Keep up your, optimism can't no one curse, me
Thinkin they can put me in a hearse, God's got me
He'll never leave me, nor forsake me, like they say
{*foreign language*} Stay focused on your goal
Stop sweatin other hoes, just rock your flow, get your own glow
My message grows like a seed planted deep inside of you
Open your mind to a new sound, lyrical prose and verse

[Kool Keith]
And verse
You know how girls are
Sometimes get complex, but we still the supermarket, and
I dibble and dabble, dibble and dabble, dibble and dabble, dibble and dabble
(Dibble and dabble) Check out my apples
I dibble and dabble, dibble and dabble, dibble and dabble, dibble and dabble
Dibble and dabble, check out the apples
CHECK~! out the apples
Check out the apples, whoahhohh

Some of the cartoon Fat Albert shirt-ass monkies
Think of the new wave overnight gangsta visit, the grave
Man you get the face, you need a close shave, go back in your hut
Think you're jealous cause I'm like Liu Kang
The man can't scratch a cut, that's right, when I get into that butt
You see the kid, like a squirrel out there you're tryin to get a nut
That's right, we come, that's right, we take girls out to Pizza Hut
We get 'em down, with the sound, groove Uptown
Northbound to the Bronx, Boogie Down, we kick to the left and right
That's right, lyrics come tight

     <lyrics>
      [ Hook ]
Blurt when you hear them sirens coming
I can hear them sirens coming
Better run when you hear them sirens coming
I can hear them sirens coming

[ Verse 1 ]
One-to-the-two-to-the-three-to-the-four
Limehouse police knocking at my door
Twelve black boots on my bedroom floor
What they want with Rascal I'm not sure
Took me to the station 8:30
For a fight that I had recently
Say they got me on CCTV
And a pussyole boy's told on me
Can't understand why these brers keep snitching
Can't understand why these brers keep bitching
Now I'm hot tempered, feel like switching
Can't stand still, trigger finger itching
Gotta stay calm, gotta keep my cool
If I go jail, I'll be a damn fool
Gotta rise up, gotta stand up tall
Can't let them see the end of Dizzee Rascal

[ Hook ]

Yo man, let's take it back to that old-school storytelling shit
Get me?

[ Verse 2 ]
One day I was with my bredren Adar roaming the street
On the main road, hungry looking for something to eat
Not no burger and no chips, shit that's easily digested
It's that shit that if you re caught you'll be easily arrested
We was on a robbing spree, I forgot to mention Clayton
Was this bredder rolling with us, he was scared and it was blatant
He was prang but back to the story, Adar spotted a man
Straight ahead of us in the distance with his wifey holding hands
So we followed them through this little alleyway into the flats
When we thought the time was perfect, we crept up and we attacked
I took the first swing, unexpected causing panic
We was ruthless causing agony in public, it was tragic
Me and Adar lost the plot, acting like we was from Hell
Beat this bredder to the floor, moved his wifey up as well
Clayton stood back shaking, wishing that he'd never came
Then from out of nowhere was Alicia screaming out my name
She went my school, she saw it all, and by this time, she's crying
And to make it worse I'm hearing sirens, I aint even trying to hang around

[ Hook ]

[ Bridge ]
I can hear them sirens coming
I can hear them sirens coming
I break the law, I will never change
I break the law, I will never change
I break the law, I will never change
Step into my zone, get your whole face re-arranged

[ Verse 3 ]
See me on the telly but I ain't no actor
Running through the street bait-faced, it's a jackwa
Broad daylight, no shame like a lunatic
Rain, hail, sleet or snow, I ain't new to it
Show me what you got, better give it up quickly
Lay them on their back if they chat back swiftly
Better mind out when they come through the manor, man
Keep them on their toes like Hammer, man
It's no joke, man, woman, and child I'm seeking
See, no sex, no age, I'm creeping
Anything for the dough, code of the wheelers
Duck from the feds and I roll with the dealers
Par with the hard heads and young offenders
No, my life ain't nothing like Eastenders
Step into my zone, get your whole face re-arranged
I break the law, I will never change

      Spell it with a K
     </title>
     <lyrics>
      [Scratches]
"Hey little soldier you ain't ready for war" (Uh uh)
"I show how to do this"
"AMATEUR!"

[Hook]
Y'all don't know who the fuck I be
I be the P to the A can't forget the C
And if you spell it with a K then you got it right
PackFM and I'm here to rock the house tonight

[Verse 1]
Welcome to the rap world (NIGGA!) population me
Been in the building since back to when it was in the place to be
Stopped doing shit for love so you can start the hating please
Once I leave these fucking agencies they drop their rates and fees
'Cause the game just ain't the same if I ain't playing it
If it's hot I've done said it so don't bother saying it
And if it ain't nice don't say nothing at all
I'm looking forward to some instrumental albums from y'all
This is a message to all, this shit could end in a brawl
I got a strong arm I slam dunk a medicine ball
You can carry on, but don't get carried away
I ring your bell like somebody's getting married today
It's BK, that's the land where the savages stay
You want beef, we Burger Kings nigga, have it your way
Cat's be like "Fuck you we ain't going your way"
The four finger ring, brass knuckles, have a nice day

[Hook]
People are you with me, better pay attention
Or we gonna hit you like (Huh!) like
Now tell me are you ready (Yeah)
Bring it back it
It's time to get it started, is you fucking with that?
A lot of niggas be like (Yeah-yeah-yeah) before they even hear me
Then they like (Uh-huh) Once they (listen to me)
And in the end they say (Ahhh) or maybe (Good god!)
And before I finish rocking they be begging me to (say it again!)

[Verse 2]
Now everywhere we go we smash a new ego
I hear no or see no evil or equals
So lay low and behold when FM's in freak mode
I'm so next level niggas think I had a cheat code
Straight from ground zero, banging like it's Baghdad
Been a bad man since you was in your Dad's bag
Rapper's can act, but we all know the deal though
Pop a cap? You wouldn't pop a tag off a pillow
Absurdity dial nine-eleven and prep 'em for surgery
When I'm in the house I'll leave you broken in to like a burglary
Now certainly you heard of me, each verse of mine been the
Fuck you I rhyme better, habitual line stepper kind
Till the break of dawn with the charm of a leprechaun
Lucky if I slap you five and it don't break your fuckin' arm
Foes is frontin' but don't want it and we know this
When I'm coming they dip back like scoliosis

[Bridge]
I be the P (P)-A (A)-C (C)-K (K)-F (What?)-M (Who)?-F (What?)-M (Who?)
I be the P (P)-A (A)-C (C)-K (K)-F (What?)-M (Who)?-F (What?)-M (Who?)

[Hook]
Y'all know who the fuck I be
I be the P to the A can't forget the C
And if you spell it with a K then you got it right
PackFM and I'm here to rock the house tonight
(I said) Now, y'all know who the fuck I be (Aight)
I be the P (Yo!) to the A can't (Yo, stop man) forget the C
And if you spell it with a K then (Jesus, yo) you got it right
PackFM (I'm comin' to get you man) and I'm here to rock

      Donnie's Lament (Mad World Remix)
     </title>
     <lyrics>
      [sample]
All around me are familiar faces
Warn out places, warn out faces
Bright and early for the daily races
Going nowhere, going nowhere

[Doc Brown (sample)]
Doc Brown, it's a disgrace, this place is like a whore house
The crooked systems the pimp that got us workin' 'til me worn out
Storm clouds so it's dark when I wake up
Same street, same run for the same bus
Same tramp with his change cup
But many pennies and tens and twenty's ain't gonna change his day up
This train sucks blood, you look familiar
Why do I know them tired eyes from somewhere in particular
Wait, nah it was yesterday
You shoved me in the chest just to race to the top of the escelate
So all we rats comin' back for more
Happy to carry the wait 'til our backs are sore
Trapped in the system of capitalism
That got us thinkin'that we have to take a shit job just to get a quick buck
Why not live the life that you want?
When your dreams too big to fit in that Burger King uniform
Forgot what humanity showed us
Now we walk around like robots 'til we go nuts
What strangers, we all creative
'Til age six then we start hearin' the same shit
From police, parents, teachers, television
Take them first steps towards a mental prison
Then at the end of ya life you like "what!"
"I was doin' time but I weren't even behind bars"
Know what blood, it's a very very (mad world)

[Chorus: Doc Brown and Lowkey (sample)]
Maintain feel the weight on my brain (mad world)
It's still the same my brains achin' with pain (mad world)
This ain't life it just doesn't feel right (mad world)
My dreams ain't nice, can't sleep at night

[sample]
Went to school and was very nervous
No one knew me, no one knew me
Hello teachers tell me what's my lesson
Looked right through me, looked right through me

[Lowkey (sample)]
From the time I was a toddler, tiny and small
I grew into a little monster in primary school
Just another name on the list at registration
The teacher never listens so I lived in desperation
By Year 6, I was sick of education
Not to mention wantin' attention but I'd sit in hesitation
Scared to ask teachers questions
Cuz I was quick to test their patience
Soon as I reached secondary, different heads were hatin'
To teachers I was already dead and buried, a product of the street's devistation
Aggy and fassies and fools and carryin' tools
Why, it's a weak explanation but I was never happy in school
Sufferin' from sleep deprivation
Teachers new my type, they saw it in me, never used eyesight
Most pretend they're blind when the older youths and new guys fight
Got sent around to the deputy heads
When the fat kid that grassed went back to sit in class
And dreamt about leavin' all my enemies dead
Many tears where eventually shed
Up 'til now I didn't know what my memories meant
Many messed with me then, all the fights left my energy spent
Teachers need to fix up, this message is for everyone bUt especially them
Intelligent kids don't grow unless they mentally fed in this (mad world)

[Chorus 2: Lowkey and Doc Brown (sample)]
Life is cruel blood, I'm tired of school (mad world)
Your mind's a tool, don't play by the rules (mad world)
That's the truth I've been trapped since youth (mad world)
My heart's bruised but I still won't lose (mad world)

      Eat Ya Beats Alive
     </title>
     <lyrics>
      [JT]
Three wheel motion around the corner on these niggaz mayne
Smashin down the block, Charlie O beat in the deck
Game, what it do? (What it do?)

[The Game]
They love the way a nigga hop them six-fours and shit
The way I, push buttons make them Diablo doors lift
The way I, stick and move, when I'm behind the wheel
of that new Escalade with the Foreman grill
The way I, peel back niggaz jerseys
It ain't your life, I'm just not a big fan of James Worthy
So wait 'til I see y'all, I'm real surgical with the Ruger
But you won't catch my face on E.R.
But you might catch them dudes from the ambulance
Squattin on top of ya mans givin 'em each CPR
Tryin to get 'em to "Breathe Again" like Toni Braxton
Told y'all 'bout comin to Cali, with them phony accents
Hollywood got movies, but it ain't no actin
So wear that bling to them awards like it ain't no jackers
We chain snatchers (twenty-fo' seven)

[Chorus: JT]
When you're on the West coast - eat ya beats alive
When ya come to the lab - eat ya beats alive
Fuckin with this cash - eat ya beats alive
Cause it's all about math - eat ya beats alive
When you're on the West coast - eat ya beats alive
When ya come to the lab - eat ya beats alive
All about this cash - eat ya beats alive
Nigga all about math - eat ya beats alive

[The Game]
It ain't nuttin to spray you faggots
Or have your moms get you a Burberry suit so you look good in that casket
It's {*reversed*} you faggots, desperado in tact
June, Drago, The Game and D-Mac (holla)
Come through in a grim reaper black Cadillac
Seven-three, ooh-wee, you see, who he
With the ugliest, flows, money hungriest
Oh, the kid got hoes, you ain't know?
Head is never optional, get my whistle, blizzow
Carry pistols, to your Sources and your Grammys
Of course it's that nigga that kick down doors
And leave rooms filled with corpses, Jordan and bloody Air Forces
To get my dough I come back like Air Jordan
Same shot, lil' older, still no nigga can hold him
Stepped back, sold crack let the Compton streets mold him
Big face said I could it, he'll bet you a G

[Chorus]

[JT]
See I'm the nigga with the most flow
Figgaro from killer Cali, reppin Get Low, niggaz know
Independent with my hustle
Couldn't give a fuck money or muscle it's time to bubble
West coast is the place where we holdin it down
Bay area thuggin, they knowin it now
I'm from the home of the Get Low, home of the get dough
Home where they want mo' so niggaz get they pistol
Run up in yo' back do', lookin for the cheddar cheese
Canary wristwatch on celebrities
Diamond bezelled iced out with hella cheese
And every fuckin link is like a masterpiece
Catch 'em slippin comin out the Burger King
Parkin lot project life, we like to spark a lot
Better known as a bandit, niggaz cain't stand it
My whole block gets hard like granite

[Chorus]

[JT] Nigga

      Pimp Juice
     </title>
     <lyrics>
      Yo, this the underground though, nigga
Haha, ya know, ye

[Verse One- Lil' Flip]
She wanna get me for my pimp juice
Cuz she gone of the x, and that grey goose
Plus Imma pimp hoe, so I can't pay you
You understand I'm the man
And gettin' money, is the motherfuckin' plan
I'm like a kick stand, cuz I'm always leanin'
I never do the speed limit, so I'm always speedin'
And it don't take much, to make me happy
Cuz I bin have this shit, way before I was rappin'
Went to cappin', before I, get to clappin'
Niggaz kamikazee style, and make sho I hit the cabin
But don't hold the grudge, when I go see the judge
Till ya locked up nigga, you can't fuck
And ya baby mama, still in the free world
You thought she had one child, now she got three girls
Boi, I'm the real mcoy, you niggaz too faced
I pull a gun to ya mouth, like toothpaste
We in a new state, tryna get the big lick
I got money on my mind, nigga fuck a bitch
Don't worry about snitch, cuz they talk too much
That's how dumb ass niggaz, get coughed up
But not me, cuz I never hang out
I got chopper bullets, watch them hoes rang out
And when them cops pull up on the scene
Nine times outta ten, Imma be wit will lean

[Hook- Lil' Flip]
I know you wanna hit the club on dubs, don't ya
I know you wanna smoke all of my bud, don't ya
I know you wanna be my new bitch, don't ya
But I'm sorry, cuz lil flip don't want ya

[Verse Two- Lil' Flip]
Yeah I don't want ya nasty ass girl, ya gotta be fine
I can't fuck a eight or a seven, you gotta be a dime
I seen you niggaz, gotta be wit stupid hoes
But I feel em, cuz them hoes buy a niggaz clothes
Fuck the clothes, make ya hoe by ya dro
Pay ya bills, change ya grills, brang you wheels
Lil flip jus got a deal, Imma keep it I got game
You should peep it, you are lame
I'm the flip, the freestyle king of the freestyle gang
I don't sniff nuthin', all I do is split buttons
When I pull up to the club, they say flip stuntin'
I'm freestylin' nigga, I hear ya writin' shit
That's why you fuckin' up nigga, it's time you say real shit

[Pimpin' Ken - talking]
Ye, Pimpin' ken, why you chillin' wit these fat ass bitches
Ya fat fat, the burger king got ya gal fat fat
Ye, ye ye, Pimpin' ken, one more time
Hey flip you know what I'm talkin' bout man
We up in this dallas texas, mayne you know what I'm talkin' bout
Know what I'm talkin' bout, check this out man
I know you talkin' bout them pimp juice man
But you know what pimp juice is mayne
It's that shit we got in the pimp cup mayne
Know what I'm talkin' bout, yea man that's that pimp juice
You that grey goose right?, it's make a hoe turn into a big moose
Ya know what I'm talkin' bout, know what I mean
Imma go pimp some money, real motherfuckin' quick man
You know we got these hoes drunk on this motherfuckin'gang bangin
You know we ain't alchoholics
We motherfuckin' pimpaholics, in this bitch man
It's Pimpin' Ken and Lil' Flip
You see us on BET, you know how we livin'
(continues talking till end of song)

      Lollypop Kats
     </title>
     <lyrics>
      [Intro: Pearl Handle]
If your shit is hot, then it's hot
If it's an original flow, watch you blow
Keep it tighter than a knot, every show
If it's not, let it go, see the top is a heavy load
We need to step it up, step it up, ya'll cats, the truck up
It's Pearl, Pearl Handles... uh, uh

[Pearl Handle]
Let's step it up with intelligence, growth and development
We sufferin', some are reluctant to stop bustin'
Hate is the most expensive indulgence, the greatest need is common sense
Supreme math, teach us consciousness
Black and dominant, check your documents
Sports, Cablevision, Jackie Robinson to Iverson
Court system, can't go margin' the Cochran
Yes, shots spark in the roof top-ins
Foul apartments, niggas is starvin'
Water bugs and mouse droppings, opeds that once had name
Straighter halls, praise the Lords, stickers in every door
Footprint picture frames in every wall
Now the play is AK's and sawed-offs
Big pistols, nickel plated cronz hit you
Rippin' you tissues, amputatin' your arms
Hidin' warm symptoms, numbin' your system
Handicap parked in the wheelchair emblem

[Naisha]
There's too much drinkin' and smokin', leads to fightin' and cursin'
Jeeps worth to see the tour Suburban
Even the body left the service, but what it takes
The early wake, for niggas to advance stakes, and best cake
More hate, leavin' bottles at wakes
We all a victim of this every day chase
Rhymes shaped, Riker's Island gates, Naisha one of the greats
I see it in my baby face, black face my way
Lettin' the aids to the presence of his day
Can crime pay? Paper cliche, saw the skies to L.A.
Up in cafe's, Holiday Inn's, the elegant
Pretend, she laid in the Benz, a honey with friends
Center of attraction, shorty playin' my direction
Feelin' these ears and these eyes, payin' attention
This goes for all the snitches, from New York to Sweden
Life is what you make it, said Esco, I rock an S.O.
Product of M.M.O., producin' the sick flow
Hittin' them up with dope blow, that terrorize your side show
And scream for more M.M.O.

[Chorus: Triggnomm]
These cats is lollypop, M.M.O. real hip hop
Killa one dart, blood on your block, we crime swap
Why your rhyme stop? High beam and lime squat
Give me light, of beatin' the mic, I give you insight

[Itchy-Fingas]
Aiyo, my eyes open, vision a million when I wrote this
Proceed caution, you take a toke and say it's potent
Just stay focused and keep your burners in a holster
These cats approach you, I make a menace of they culture
Writin' exact, generate, money in stacks, for the whole summer
I'm slumped in a bulletproof hummer
Federal serve, observe, up in the telly in a hot tub
We rock clubs, ya'll niggas better cop more Icebergs
Hit ice and chains, niggas that ain't ice in your Range
Where the pricey thing? I stop back and let your life hang
Up in the zone, press chrome against flesh and bones
I see ya'll niggas ain't ready, the more guns, the merry
Put rhymes, confetti style, turn fed the criminal
Hit your general, four times, spread him around

[Ill Knob]
Who be the thug criminal, hit you hard with the subliminal
Individual, Ill Knob, with the visual
Attack, where my niggas at? Watch your step, don't forget
We be rollin' deep like, beauty when she sleep through
Snow White with your seven dwarfs, slash, faggot ass, little maggot ass
Beat you down and drag your ass
What you talkin' bout, snitched on my man and took the walk about
Outline your sketch on the pavement, what's the talk about?
The murder rap, couldn't beat the case, cause you heard the rap
Chewin' on the telephone wires, at the Burger Shack
5-0 rush in the lab, paraphernalia down the toilet
Everything was good, 'til niggas spoiled it
The foul underhanded ways'll get your ass clapped
Ga Bow nigga, blaow nigga, where you runnin' now, nigga?

[Chorus 2X]

[Interlude: Triggnomm]
These cats is lollypop, lollypop cats
M.M.O., official, operation, all upon cooperation
Russ Prez on the track, never wiz-ack
Mac to your biz-ack, what nigga, lollypop cats
M.M.O. real hip hop, Klik Ga Bow cats, foul cats, A.T.L. cats

[Chorus]

     <lyrics>
      One time for your mind, here we go
You know my style, now peep the flow
Girl I know you're with it, so drop your seven digits
Got a minute, then let me know			     (Repeat 2x)

Shorty's got it going on (Is that so, who you be?)
I'm a slick type of nigga that like to lounge on the low
(I be seeing you around) That's all dead
I just swing and do my thing and lay low like the Feds
Straight up real, no scam
(So where your girl at?) Probably out with your man
(Yeah yeah, that rapping is nice)
My mack is precise, I'm on you like a tracking device
Forget a crew, I got solo tactics
I'm not a half-ass nigga, baby I got the total package
I never fronted, you can get it if you want it
Won't say I'm the best, but I'm not that far from it
You know my style (You like to play low)
(You probably be going "Yeah yeah") Okay, if you say so
Give me a minute and it's over
I'm one bad soldier, I was flexing before Mad Cobra
I got so much charm, even if you with your moms
Huh, I play it cool like the Fonz
Whether weekends, Monday through Friday
I know this ain't Burger King, but I'll still have it my way

One time for your mind, here we go
You know my style, now peep the flow
Girl I know you're with it, so drop your seven digits
Got a minute, then let me know			      (Repeat 2x)

Oooh, shorty's got it going on (Who you be?)
A ruffneck, living for '95 and beyond
(I see you playing around the field)
I used to stick and move, now I just lounge and chill
I'm not the type to be sweating crazy
(I need a real man) Shit, I'm as real as you get, baby
My game is outstanding
(I got a boyfriend) Well now you got a man friend
(Oh it's like that?) Is you kidding? Shit...
I got so much game, I could make a nun change religions
I got flavors like a rainbow, you dig what I'm saying?
(Yeah, but that shit is all game, though)
Come on, I know you like it
Don't font on me, I read your whole card like a psychic
(Yeah, you got clout) No doubt, plus I'm getting money
Ain't a brother out teaching when I'm kicking, honey
I'm like Silk and H-Town, can you dig it?
I'll lick you up and down and knock your boots in a minute
Messing with me, nothing but good can happen
There's a new sheriff in town
(Really, where?) You're looking at him

One time for your mind, here we go
You know my style, now peep the flow
Girl I know you're with it, so drop your seven digits
Got a minute, then let me know			      (Repeat 2x)

I'm not the type to act a fool, catching brothers with a tool
I just bag up skins, I play it cool
I kick game, I have your mind is
Cause I can be bummy and nappy headed, and still pull a Dom P
(Pimping is hard) Not to me
You got a lot to see, the way I put skins under lock and key
And let them front the role like they outstanding
Huh, I leavem 'em out standing in the cold
A girl act up, then I cut her off
(Is your game smooth?) Is it? My shit's butter soft
So won't y'all just hear me in
(Why's that?) I get girls open like a cesarian
Yo, I roll with the big men and I don't have to trickin'
And mess around just to get skins
So all y'all niggas that's geese, I can make that shit cease
When I slide up in the peace

One time for your mind, here we go
You know my style, now peep the flow
Girl I know you're with it, so drop your seven digits
Got a minute, then let me know			      (Repeat 4x)

      Smoking Amp
     </title>
     <lyrics>
      Nip: Yo Triple Six pass the motherfucking amp....
Nigga, everybody else wanna get fucked up too.
Triple Six: man, hold up man,
I ain't even hit the motherfucker good yet
Nip: Well go on hit the bitch one more time.....

It starts off in my house somking amp
Feening for blood like a motherfucking vamp
I kept hittin' now my brains on fire
I felt like stuffin' motherfuckers in a dryer
So I take my last puff, then I shot my motherfucking
Next door neighbour for good luck
I jetted to the car, strapped with a fork and a 20 legged chainsaw
Im rollin' down the block, that' s when I saw this pussy ass cop
Pissed in his car like I said in "slaughter",
Bannana clips (gunshots) to his daughter
He pulled his gun, I reached for my axe
And drew "texas" in blood on his motherfucking back
I wasn't through, he said I was soft
Flashbacks from walking town cut his motherfucking legs off
Jumped in the ride then I fired up another square
Slowed down tokin' had me pulling out my fucking hair
Stopped at a store to get a 40
Something in the air said: "it's time to get naughty"
I got pissed, and took me a beer
(tripple gunshots) down with the cashier
She died in my violent capure,
(what happend next??) Then tripple six raped her
This nigga started screaming for heaven,
He tried to run but he died on isle seven
Now it' s time to break camp,
Fucking with that motherfucking amp

Triple Six: ohhh nip, man, I'm fucked up man, here man, take this
Nip: ohhh me too .. I fenna kill a bitch...

Back on the block sounds messing with my head,
Even before some amp eyes blood shot fucking red
So I drive to a burger king,
Looking real motherfucking mean.
Thingking about a hearse
Shot the people in front of me, cause I wanna order first
*may I help you brother??*
- (triple gunshots) help that motherfucker!
Cut out his heart then he felled to his knees,
It' s tasty like a whopper with cheese
Saw some people at a table eatin'
It' s halloween, time for trick' a' treatin'
I walked over then the little boy got scared,
He kissed his mother then he gave me his fucking head
She got mad and hit me in the chin,
So I stabbed her in the neck with a 20-foot stick pen
A little girl kicked me dead in my chest,
For 20 days I was kicking her in her fucking breast
I tried to stay calm,
Trading urin samples out a motherfucking arm
Her daddy, he thought he was hard,
I went insane put her pain out his spinal chord
I had visions of a lamp,
Fucking with that motherfucking amp.

Nip: Damn Triple six, this is our last amp square!
Triple: for real man?
Nip: hell yeah
Triple: alright, look...

Rolling once again with the amp controlling me,
I wander west, the fuck's coming over me
I hit the now it' s time for a _________ ??
Driving on the sidewalk hitting people
I saw this little sweet ol' lady,
*nip you gonna kill her??* - yeah, maybe
She started walking across the street,
Fenna get her motherfucking ass beat
I blew my horn, she shoulda been listening,
Hit her ass so hard, her head rolled to Michigan
Innocent bystanders dead course I dropped one,
Like Scarface said: - "I pop one"
I kept hitting, and kept getting mean,
Shot every motherfucker I saw under 13
There got the cops, it' s time for death,
Loaded up the 12 guage, and I killed myself, fuck...

      Here We Go Again
     </title>
     <lyrics>
      Now who say Dog Boy only come
in a reggae fashion?!
My Mom say "Never Judge a Book by
It's Cover."
Turn the page to discover,
You got the reggae on one and
the punk rock ragamuffin on the other,
Richter...!

You know it's time to leave my house, so I slid out the door,
Had this hole in my pocket so my sack hit the floor,
Now this ain't nothing new I've had these jeans for years,
Hopped into my bus and started banging the gears,
Took it on the redline then I slapped into,
Reached in-between my seats and I pulled out another brew,
But now I'm 5-0-2 it ain't the route for me,
So I grab some chicken littles from KFC,

I'ma go to Mickey D's get a burger with some cheese,
Discuss these plans how I'm flippin' these keys,
Capisce, a cuz a cuz you don't' know him,
I'll give it to my friend, know him, we spilt the door,
Back in the bus we puffs, kept rollin',
Scoot Dog Boy, Daddy X is holdin',
There go the potion look you're frozen,
Damn this bud's good

Here We Go Again, Bump 2000,
Here We Go Again, Bump 2000,
Forward The Plan,
Forward The Mission,
Here We Go Again, Bump 2000,

BUMP BUMP!!
You know how the sound flows,
BUMP BUMP!!
Yo it's like that you know,
BUMP BUMP!!
Babylon beware we got one microphone for the world to share!

I got a '85 caddy with the Clarion Amp,
With some 10's in the trunk for punks who wanna bump my shit,
Bang, rattle your chest and brain,
Frame by frame rearrange your shit,
Adjust your amps and your shit might hit,
Don't quit to the beat, the bass gets deeper,
Listen to the tones as they crush your speakers with the little thump,

Well yup I'm still drunk with the humps in the trunk,
You hear the Kottonmouth Kings yellin' out BUMP! BUMP!
I flew through a yellow then I ran a red,
Grabbed a bev saw a cop then hit the clutch and breath,
Knew I had to slow down so I smoked a bowl,
Picked up D-Loc and told him start to roll,
Freeway was packed so I paid the toll,
Four joints later my bus was fishbowled,


Here We Go Again, Bump 2000,
Here We Go Again, Bump 2000,
Forward The Plan,
Forward The Mission,
Here We Go Again, Bump 2000,

BUMP BUMP!!
You know how the sound flows,
BUMP BUMP!!
Yo it's like that you know,
BUMP BUMP!!
Babylon beware we got one microphone for the world to share!

Jamaica island of the sounds
And all you ever hear is the bass and drum
I said the ?????????????
???????????????????
?????????????? ragamuffin
????????? wicked rhythm
??? ride through Jamacian countryside

When it come to music lord we love it
Any style we ???????????
Bump 2000 lord here we come again
First time around we rock all across the land

How's that sound with the tick and the bump,
I puff the skunk while I'm settin' off alarms,
EQ my Mid so my highs don't twitch,
I drop bombs while your sounds blown to shit,
I like to sip on my binger,
Ice water rips are cleaner,
Push the bowl down with my finger,
Then i snapped a load,
The bud i got is meaner,
Felony no misdemeanor,
Got a Beamer same as Zingers',
With the system full blown,

Daddy X, correct, Who'd You Expect?
The mans ???????? connect,
????????????,
X is for ecstasy,
Is that why the fucker's standing next to me,
Or is it because I'm a Kottonmouth King,
With pounds and pounds and pounds of Florida keif,
Naw no thang smoke ring coinsure,
You'll never find my bong water dirty like the sewer,

Here We Go Again, Bump 2000,
Here We Go Again, Bump 2000,
Forward The Plan,
Forward The Mission,
Here We Go Again, Bump 2000,

BUMP BUMP!!
You know how the sound flows,
BUMP BUMP!!
Yo it's like that you know,
BUMP BUMP!!
Babylon beware we got one microphone for the world to share

      Down for the Cause
     </title>
     <lyrics>
      [Hyjak]
If someone you know's in the room talking to the wall all day
Don't be afraid, it probably means they went out and bought my tape
Cause all it takes is these freshly chopped herbals
and I can rhyme the language that translates crop circles
Controversial cause I contest commercial rappers
'Jak is throwing bottles while they rolling in their convertibles
Don't take it personal, I was born to burn you off
With words so berserk I'm forced to stay disguised like Surfer
Call me "Crime Watcher", that's right I watch guns and laugh
and take my half of the profits after watching for cop cars
I can't cooperate, only operate
Chase promoters for dough that they owe us and take what's in their bank

[Chorus 2X: sample]
"People, people want to see me get busy cause I'm
Very, very dope when I'm spitting the funky line"

[Pressure]
I'm down for the cause like suicide bombers
I made a life promise pushing underground through city night corners
Suddenly spread through these southernly treads
I've got a beautiful mind, it's just stuck in an ugly head
I'm stunning with skill while some are run-of-the-mill
We coming real, we're from Adelaide ... {"One in a mill'"}
This underground's broke, by any means we ain't getting CREAM
So the scene will burn you never-beens like Aussie Centrelink
The larger a fool's ego, the harder they fall
So I drink till I can hardly recall a party at all
I've had enough, while they acting tight I'm acting up
I don't put emcees under +Pressure+, I ain't into all that faggot stuff
This rhyme addiction's so bad, I'ma go mad
and stick up emcees for their thoughts and add 'em to the vocab
If life's a bitch, then death's a slut
cause death comes for everyone and when it's your turn, you're fucked

[Chorus 2X]

[Hyjak]
I think I've finally lost the plot, let's have a round of applause
I'm down for the cause, I'm moving mountains, bouncing off walls
with countless cordlesses, confused counsellors talking shit
Forced to spit from now until I'm on stage with walking sticks
Depicting a portrait of an anti-corporate kid
Scared rappers getting court orders against such rawness
I'm mad for life, in the club hand me the mic
I kick one verse and get myself banned for life
If these hecklers dissing when I'm standing on stage
I'ma call you out and show you the true meaning of crowd participation
Roll a down ass chick, then slap the shit out of a groupie
and distract store managers, while I'ma steal a nicker at movies
Forever broke, no job, nowhere left to go
Jerry Springer comes on and I've already seen the episode
That's when you know you're really unemployed, brain destroyed
Step into Centrelink and you see all your fucking boys ... {"HEY!"}

[Chorus 2X]

[Suffa]
Emcees claim they moving units {"They serious?"} That's not the fact though
The fact is you couldn't sell a burger to Fat Joe
Think you're all of that? {"NO!"} You be pulling back bro
{"Jack Lives Here"} You call him Jack, I call him Fatso
I pack shows, slap flows, I've been in de factos
Step on this mic, and when you're like flat tobacco
my style's more fatal than second-hand medicine
I even bought veteran's, Hip Hop connects as well as Thomas Edison
through lettering and underground peddling
I get these kids open like lungs of Ventolin
Presenting them with controversy like Jello Biafra
I'm down for the cause, protect these artists like we're APRA
Like cats on Viagra I can serve you all night
Call me the customer {"Why's that?"} Cause I'm always right
And I'm always mad tight like rich people with funds
And the style's more deadly than sharing needles with bums

[Chorus 2X]

I don't get it
Y'all forget about me for a whole year, right?
I move on with MY life
Drop a CD and now everybody got somethin' to say
Kills me...takin' cheap shots, callin' me names
Y'all must've forgot who I was yo

Check it, allow me to reintroduce myself, my name is
D, A-double-N to the Y, I
Got in trouble last year and I can't lie
Took the rap for a hundred people, and I
Came back to give my side of the story
Head of the class, but jealous people tried to extort me
Tried to say my money stretched a little wider than Porky
Th-th-that's all, leave it to me to re-up with heat
I need to breathe people, so back off

[Danny! talking]
Y'all had to get me started
It's bad enough I gotta deal with this everyday, y'know
I mean, sometimes it gets lonely man
I think about it at night
Y'know, all the people that claimed to be my best friend
Turnin' their backs on me
Someone even had the audacity to ask me last week
If I knew the code to break into the computer system
I'm like, are you serious?
I'll give you the code all right
And that number is
(7-8-5, 4-7
I'm not givin' out the rest)
Lemme stop before I incriminate myself any further
Charlamagne already does a good job of that

[Verse 2]
You people can't get past my past
I'm gassed, at last they asked
Me to be the scapegoat, so take note
I'ma say this one time and one time only
I'ma keep pleadin' my case until the sun shine on me
Regardless of what happened at Claflin
I'm glad that I'm rappin'
At least I'm doing something with my life
Unlike, you other cats still sittin' through assembly at school
I'm fixin' to be sittin' in a Bentley, it's cool
Some cats never heard of me
So they run and get their little rumors from Burger King
Last week my label got a phone call from Murder Inc.
But y'all don't care about that
You'd rather try to hold this cat back
Get on radio and mention my past
But I'm laughin' 'cause pretty soon y'all be kissin' my...
D. Swain, the source of Charlamagne's rage
Now we on the same page, maybe YOU should change grades
Holla at ya boy

[Danny! talking]
Y'all got me embarrassed man
I had to make like, three beats in two hours
Y'know, I'm spittin' over unfinished material right now
But uh, don't worry
I saved the heat for last
Still wanna talk to y'all, so um
Just gimme a minute of your time real quick
I got somethin' to say, get off my chest

[Verse 3]
Soon as somebody gets a trick, a gimmick
You pricks get in it
Quicker than Christmas dinner with grits and spinach
Invested hard work and made a decent album
Now you people wanna treat me like police did Malcolm?
I'll keep the peace, but how come
Every time I try to turn down the hate, y'all increase the volume?
Dag! Y'all released the beast outta him
Now he's on a rampage, it's too late to reach out to him
Hearsay's for queers, expelled Danny off a hunch?
I guess they had their panties in a bunch
I'm just Payton a picture...oops!
Did I say "Payton"? I meant to say "painting" a picture
So keep takin' your cheap shots, it don't phase me at all
I dream big but was born small
Callin' me a cornball? I was the best on the yard
Keep poppin' junk, you'll be wakin' up with F's on your card, holla

[Danny! talking]
And it's final exam season so I would watch out if I were you
The Boogie Man is back, yeah
I do it for the underdogs, man
Can't hate me for this one, I had to
Man, y'all got me started, for real
You can't expel somebody off of hearsay and no evidence man
But the irony of it is, I still want my brick in Legacy Plaza
So um, after I blow up I'ma give a million dollars to Claflin, word up
Can't hate me for that
D. Swain, c'mon let's go

     <lyrics>
      hook

We'll I'm just gonna tell you
We ain't bout' that talking homeboy, we'll do it
And all that acting you doing, we see through it
Fuck hollering and screaming lets get to it, lets get to it

(Cee-Lo)
Now I say my rap reflect the enemy
Passion and positive energy
Y'all talk about killing, it don't surprise me
Tripping bout' a nigga, don't judge me wisely
But I ain't bout' to holler or scream at you
You can look in my eyes and tell what I'd do
I'm a charge at niggas and you know I'm true
But goddammit, fuck nigga this one for you
I know how it go, I done been out there before
Heard its goddamn ?time to blow?
Stomping niggas down till they don't want no more
Trying to get some Polo's straight out the store
Some gone, some just can't let it go
I might laugh and joke, but I'll let a nigga know
I'm the same motherfucker from 84
And I still do it in the aftershow
And I don't like to feel like I'm being tried
I ain't bullet-proof, plenty nigga done died
But I damn sho' ain't finna go and hide
I got one on me, and I'm down to ride
I ain't trying to say I got all the game
I got fame, but a million I can't claim
So respect me playa, and I'll do the same
But neither one is guaranteed to have the best aim

hook

(T-Mo)
The revolution has begun...........
Handle your business playa
Devoted to the game, and dope cut-throat ways will get you paid in full
Pull a rabbit out the hat trick, magical quick
Slick its like a porn flick
Umm... Imagine having money so big
It makes you look like a pig
Get your big behind
You remind me of swine with your fat nose
Stuck in your pose and ?thread bed? that shawty
Lame with your game, put it all on the table
Got your label and your fast cars, and your bodyguard looking hard
Throwing your cheese, for them rats its snacks
I'm like a egg bout' to hatch
Tony, horny, I'm macaroni
Commercialize suckers looking like busters
I'd ride for the kings and queens of my motherfucking team
Spark in the night, ummmm we bout to fight
Haters, come and say that shit,
Dammit these fools gonna have to take us together
How the fuck, ever you want it, get to it
SWATS

hook

(Khujo)
The streets making you feel like a real G
But we Georgia finest, our Fulton County fleet
You still putting thangs up in your mouth
Cause you been pacifired, since you was knee-high
All your life in school, thats the reason why you couldn't learn nothing
Runt, at the tender age of 18, books no longer hold your attention span
Short term, but you can sho' enough count that green
Something you just can't coach
Don't sing it, bring it
I usually caught me at least one fool a game
You can only phanthom pain, I don't have to
But don't let me get on a case of this drank
Leak to my heart, elevate to my brain
Make you wanna walk that plank
You'd better swim motherfucker
Cause bullshit don't float
You are what you eat
See you remind of this goat that I had by the hairs of his chinny-chin-chin
Curbing over some yellow rice, you can't do shit
Might as well hit the graveyard shift
Somewhere at McDonalds or Burger King
Grab a taste or spill, over some hairs, nobody cares
And we do assholes that grip leather chairs

hook

(Big Gipp)
I used to hang out, smoke out, fuck out, bang out
Run your mouth wrong, got your front tooth took out
On the spot bodies with no heads, no legs, no feet
Left em' out in the open scoping that ass out for weeks
Never speaking, busting, breaking brains
Berettas brought the rain back and forth
Trigger action, snatch it up, load it up
Hit the door, gotta call, yo' he at the mall
Fuck it all, hit em' one, two, three times
I was scared the first shot, but liked the second and third
Left him hollering and screaming, dreaming for another chance to live
Had it up yesterday, but today its mine
Bust your ass one more time, for the niggas on the grind
So go and hide

     <lyrics>
      [Intro - Juelz]
Yeah, who, where they at, bring em to me
Let me talk to these niggas man, Dip-set ya'll wit me

[Chorus - Juelz]
Ayo listen to this gangsta, feel this music man
Get into this gangsta, cause this is just for gangstas
Where my niggas at, where my bitches at
Get into this gangsta, cause this is just for gangstas

[Juelz Santana]
Now lets get down to business, I've been gone
For a minute, but I'm back now down for business
Yeah I found a small town I had to visit
I had a bunch of hungry workers , who was down to get it
So I got up and left, it the town with rizicks
Nickels dimes quarters own have of rizicks
Know the rules of getting mad, If they ask they get it
Plus I was giving it to them, like I had permission
Now I'm back focused on rap, anybody got a problem holla back
Two shots swallow that, and I know what the people want
Got what the people want, I know you not hot
You not what the people want, they want me Santana man bandana
Rapped around his hand, got damnmit man is it him?
Yes say it again, yes I'm playing to win
Yes hey come again, niggas I've been watching
I've been plotting, I'm the realest thing poppin
Since Osama Bin Laden, so pay homage
Ladies salute me, gentlemen salute me, the gentlemen you'll soon see

[Chorus 2x]

[Cam'Ron]
Ayo this is just for gangstas, then I black out, mack out
Bling out, shing out, and shank ya
Ya'll looking lost, took your plates, gave it to crooks
The forks (go eat), we gon eat whether, its fish or pork
They thirsty already, they take a burger, turkey and veggie
You ever work wit meshedy's, I broke bread with billionaires
That think flippin birds is petty, they soon serve wit semi
My tune turn to envy, balloon pop you know
I burn the friendly, and pull cars off
I'm so nice, I took the last two bars off
I wasn't rapping nothing, I was rapping something, now that was stunting
And baby I model, I always put the coke in the baby powder bottle
Killa, cause I follow for figures, I hollow the trigger
Swallow a nigga, like a bottle of liquor (Hennessey)
And when I cock that heat, back the hatch back hard top
Or drop top seat back, harving and reach back
Body in the seat, head in the trunk
Tell his mother eat that, later feet fat
Ima batter boy, Ohio players, Detroit cheddar boy
Harlem too, gangstas do it, Montana Santana, gangsta music killa

[Chorus 2x]

[Juelz Santana]
Yo I got you niggas exhausted, you gotta be nauseous
How I pull up, stop and be flossing
Oh chrome wheels spinning, out of proportion
Twin pipes on the back, letting out the exhaustion
Whoa kids love me, but I'm no idol
I hold rifles, dogg my spit game
Is so vital, I'm with the games been missing
Like both Michaels , Jackson to Jordan
From cracking to balling, I'm back
I'm a heavy pimper, 24/7 pimper
Where your girl, go get her, bet I pimp her
And I aint mad, that the towers fell
I'm mad the coke, price went up, and the crack won't sell
I'm mad I gotta grind harder, hit the block harder
Get some new workers, buy some new proda
Get my clientele back, shit I might as well black
Burn the town down one more time, what the hell scrap
For my niggas who can't get it, up state sittin in san Quentin
Greens on they back on the feet, stand spliffing
This is gangsta music, please dance wit it
Spit your razors out, partying the mess all
This is just for gangstas, parting all the rest of ya'll
Juelz Santana make it happen man, dip-set grip tecs harlems own taliban

[Chorus 2x]

     <lyrics>
      [Prince Poetry]
There's a breeze, 34 degrees of heat
Jeeps pumping Organized, kids in the street
Bugging, brothers in the car with brand new pumps
50 bars, oh man
It's kinda sunny so I'm sliding on the down
Low, waiting for Divine to come around
So we can be out, weather of caravan of honeys to the beach
To burn my toes in the sand

[Pharoahe Monch]
Running to motivate, lace up the boots real tight
Pants are sagging, we're hanging all night
But I got to get a bite to eat
Cause I be needing nourishment to move my feet
Now it's about time that we round up the heard
So I can get lifted, word
Who's got the weed and beat, yes I'm ready to get elevated

[Prince Poetry]
Never hesitated, to round up the heard for a night of ex-
Citement, tight to the look of ?lie lighten?
Philly, 40 dogs passed around
Hanging with Han Solo and ??? now we're New York bound
Back to the Southside of town where I flip it
In the summer, I pumps the drummer up so I can kick it
Represent Organized as I walk into the sun
And that's how it went

[Female singing]                    [Organized Konfusion]
Everybody, everybody		    Walk...in...to...the...sun
Walk into the, walk into the sun    As I walk into the sun  (Repeat 2x)

[Pharoahe Monch]
Put one foot in front of the other
That's how we walk into the sun my brother
Put away your razors, knives, guns
No need for that, black, as we walk into the, sun
Or should I say run?
Chasing girls with the big fat buns
Mmmm, or should I say "bitty?"
I know Smitty's, girls with the big fat (ahhhh!)
Nah, I can't say that
I love when you touch 'em and they say "I don't play that"

[Prince Poetry]
Oooooh, give me mine as I walk into the sunshine
Cars going "Beep Beep"
Bully-Burger bound to get something to eat
Uptown, ain't no other way, sugar
I'd rather squash the beef, but never hesitate a moment to pull a
Trigger to protect self
Kicking the wicked styles I could possibly kick to my last breath
Deleting the idiot who commences to lollygag
Riding a black doo rag to bed, to work, to play, mmmm, whatever
Mmmmm, word, that's what's happening
So I will say like mmmmm come get it
Collect loot and with the Monch I split it
Money B and Tupac is my West Coast connect
When I'm in the Bay Area on the set
As I walk into the sun I got to give props to the supporters
And the ones who bought us cause the rest get the buttocks

[Pharoahe Monch]
Let the sun shine in, greet it with a grin
Open up your heart and let the sun shine in
I'm having sex on the beach with a black Russian
See we was discussing our fuzzy navel
She used to live on Long Island with Iced Tea
And a sneaky little freak named Bloody Marie
She was Absolut-ly on some other Kamikaze type tip, she
The way she dove on me, held my hand
Walking along the boardwalk, kicking sand
And not to mention the air gets thick
In the summer so I buy pants thin and quick
No we're not cowards, dammit, but life's a beach
So you never catch me in Howard
Chilling together, however, I'm gonna walk into the sun
No matter the weather

[Female singing]                    [Organized Konfusion]
Everybody, everybody		    Walk...in...to...the...sun
Walk into the, walk into the sun    As I walk into the sun  (Repeat 2x)

Everybody, everybody, you gotta walk into the sun
Got to get away, walk into the sun

Walk!

      Ooh yeah
Mh
Hey yo, man
Ain't nothin like a nice bowl of cornflakes in the morning
to smooth you out

Milky
Cereal
(Baby)
Milky
Cereal	(2x)

[ VERSE 1 ]
Mirror, mirror on the wall
Who's the baddest female of them all?
It was Frosted Flake, she loved to bowl
And although her skin was white she had a lot of soul
Rich female, very debonnaire
Drivin a Rolls with rollers in her hair
We was hangin out, pumpin the stereo
She took me to a club, I think the name was Cheerio's
She walked like she was jumpin a hurdle
I was happy as a kid that just saw _Mutant Ninja Turtles_
A guy walked over, said, "Your earring's cute"
I said, "I'm wearin a earring, but it ain't no Fruit Loop"
Me and Frosted went to get a drink
But she ordered somethin bugged and I ain't know what to think
She ordered potassium, calcium
Carbohydrate scotch with sodium
She took me to her crib, threw me on the couch
I woke up the next morning with a spoon in my mouth
She's

Milky
Cereal
(Baby)
Milky
Cereal	(4x)

[ VERSE 2 ]
I went to Vegas, didn't think it'd do any harm
I walked into this girl named Lucky Charm
For some reason we walked in the rain
She had a four-leaf clover with a big gold chain
She had a salary that was full of calories, for real
And I was in the mood for a homecooked meal
So we went to be alone
But we had to be quiet, cause her cornpops was home
Kissed her neck, kissed her back, kissed her arms
I said, "Forget it, let me see your lucky charms"
When we began her hairstyle was neat
But when I left the next morning it looked like shredded wheat
Talked about marriage, I said, "That's risky
Besides, it's such a waste of Rice Crispies"
She had a robe with the velours material
Her pops woke up, I said, "Hello Mr. Cereal
I came this morning to deliver the paper"
He said, "Stop frontin, I know you caught the vapors
That's my daughter, so save your croonin
You better find another bowl of cereal to stick your spoon in"

Milky

Yeah, check this out here:

[ VERSE 3 ]
Then there was Pebbles, times was rough
She was turnin tricks to get her 'coo-coo puff!'
Her mind was gone, but she turned me on, in fact
She was wearin an Apple Jack hat
With a full-link fox and some pink bobby-socks
Her father had a greedy disease, fried chicken pocks
We called him Hungry Jack
He talked like pops, and then he dressed like The Mack
He invited me out to lunch
With a old army buddy of his, Captain Crunch
The waiter said, "Jack, what would you like today?"
He said, "I don't know, just make it Special, 'K?"
He said, "Cool," came back with the order
That's when I said, "Hey yo, Jack, I like your daughter"
He said, "Pebbles? Boy, are your crazy?
I said, "Nah, I wanna ride in a Mercedes
She could sing while I'm swingin my thing
Cause her burgers taste better than Burger King"
He said, "Go party, do some minglin
You and my daughter, your brain must be jinglin"
I said, "It's smooth, no disrespect
She'll sign a pre-nup, so she don't get half of my week check"
Then we walked down the aisle
Our honeymoon was milky - cereal style

You know what I'm sayin?

      Pink Cookies in a Plastic Bag
     </title>
     <lyrics>
      The act of makin love...is...

[REFRAIN]
pink cookies in a plastic bag, gettin crushed by buildings
pink cookies in a plastic bag, gettin crushed by buildings

I'll take 30 electric chairs
and put'em in a classroom
30 MC's
and set'em free from thier doom.
just like a tomahawk cuts through the wind
when we begin
the wheel of furtune it spins
holdin'
the rhythm like elastic
moldin'
your whole body like plastic
so why try to deny what ya already know ya love
up above
cause the mania
hysteria
in the streets
while ya lovers gettin merrier
in the sheets
I met this lady named
sweet young thing and
she gave me that feelin
that sunshine bring in.
Hordable
sportable
totally affordable
silky smooth
voice was real audible.
I said your cool as Ice Cuba
she said, "your that Public Enemy
I seen on the tuba."
Naw.
I'm like your Uncle baby.
The style of your beautiful face
drives me crazy.
Well can we do ya so Heavy ah D?
She said, "You tried to play me
like Big Dad-dy."
I said, "I know your Tribe,
I Called and re-Quested
for you to be manifested."
She said, "You know the Same Gang and my Flava Unit too?"
I said, "You only knew the certain things I wanna do, do you?"
Rub ya down with warm Ice-T
make ya feel Bran Nubien
in-stant-ly.
Boogie Down
and check this Production.
Gimme them lips
they look good for suction.
She said, "Sweet tease
cool with a little almond joy
on the side
just doin' the fly"
You like poundcake?
Comin' to my house
turn on the lights
and see me on the couch.
I said, "Do the jingle
and your from around the way.
I like your earrings
L's
but anyway...
Your grand-daddy is
here to spread cheer.
Somethin nice and smooth
with my tounge in your ear.
Give me a snack
some Salt And Pepper on a burger.
Ice Cube T
or if you prefer the
taste of honey Kid
ride in my Capri and
that's the joint
they got the real clear CD in.
She said, "Stars couldn't get me in a car.
I don't know what type of man ya are.
You might know karate
do me and get away
I got a glimpse of your license plate
N-W-A."

[REFRAIN] (x2)

She was Chubb-y and
ready to Rock
Naughty By Nature and
part of my private stock and
ridin in the relax
frame of mind and
hmmmmmmmmmmmm...
Hammer timin.
Incredible.
So edible
and unforgettable.
Soft like a Q-Tip
I'd love to get with you
cause I'm the type of guy that got props do
Feel it in mo and more.......
When I get ready for a showcase
put together well
I go deep
and have an oil well
show and tell.
I said, "Yo-Yo!
You're so intelligent
and elegent."
I n-I never Run to be D
with another MC
I got what I want
right in front of me.
I know a kid named K
he's a MD.
Last time I heard
yo, was gettin real friendly.
Belly to belly and
chest to chest
thigh by thigh
leg by leg and
I guess.
Ain't no way to get ya out
your so caught up S-E-X-U-A-L - sort
of a freaky situation
with a peppermint twist
Ricky or Mike is next on the list.
Nastified and all-funkified
Come'on
Come'on
Come'on
ride.
Can you hear?
Never fear
whatcha hear.
What ya hear
is it clear?
Understand
and love ya big dear
and I will appear
my dear
with a beer
and bags full of cheer
and waterbed...
YEAH!
Cause I rumble and groan.
She said, "You got to be bad to
make the moanie moan."
Ain't no reason to front
on the way your life shown.
Booyaa!
How I'm jumpin' your bones
like a Grand
Master in a Flash.
Put out your cigarette
and rest your tired ash.
All I wanna do
is make woopie
your my pink cookie.
Not a wookie
when you take it off
I'd love a lookie.
Cause I'ma mix it up toss style.
Peace out
you got the sexual profile.

      Uh
G'yeah (It's all love, baby)
Here we go y'all (Uh, huh)
I'm 'bout it
The streets/The nickels
The four and the strip and
Niggas who grits with the ave
The hood and them whores who be stripping

For all them victims in the tenements fixin' syringes
You can smell the dope up in they pores and it's sickening
Ayo they closing schools
Building prisons
They plyin' jewels
Killing children
Willing to live in anything
Eat anything
Teach us anything
I speak with street ministry
Over percussion and liters of Hennessey
From the gutters the Greek assemba-ly
Osiris on a cliff rolling a fig leaf
Oh, shit--I digs deep mentally
What every rapper wanna be
They see what they meant to be
And see Blak killing a track with such easy energy
See and peep my similes
Every two lines I switch up the flow
Every word a different meaning when I shift between 'em
Now who greater than thou?
With that worldwide connect to the easy way to making a thou'
Overseas or in the States get it down
Get around like 'Pac and Shock on singles
When I'm in your town yo
Overseas or in the States get it down
Get around like 'Pac and Shock
When I'm in your town ya know

[Chorus]
Hot fire water
You sugar water
You sweeter than MC's that we be in ya know
Every beat is like a four-alarm blaze
But just be careful stay away from the flames
Now that's a fire nigga
Hot fire water
You sugar water
You candy that I take from a baby
You just a clown that get down around here
But you won't be around next year
Yeah

Ayo
Now when I get on you can tell 'em that it won't stop
'Less Big, 'Pac, Pun, and L comin' back
One with the drum
I spit with the rhythm
Sink to the beat
Simpty the lyric
Empty my spirit
To the MP you hearin'
MIDI the sequence
Gimme them streets
They mind ya mens be the weakest
I shine shimmer if peepin' my lines
Like lemon juice squeezin' in lines (Drink a twist)
Limited reasoning
While peoples'll never think of this
Just give me a reason and I'm squeezin' chip
He could live
Beef ain't for season' ya know
We frying bigger fish
We buying bigger whips
We tying sicker kicks
In your own hood/I'm more acknickulous
On your own block I got a thicker bitch
It's poppin'/It's crackin'
You flowin' you know it 'bout to happen
Going overseas
Stockin' and stackin'
Coming home chop it and pack it
Hit the block the mattress
That mean flip it/Profit is stacking
Yo get at me nigga
I cock it and pack it for cocky-ass rappers
And any nigga in the hood that wanna pop me that matter
I said I cock it and pack it for cocky-ass rappers
Or any nigga in the hood wanna pop me that matter
It's so hot

[Chorus]

Uh, huh
Newtron Entertainment/Uh, huh
Millenia/Uh, huh
DJ Revolution/Soul Supreme/Uh, huh
Ill Advised/Jay-Ski
Uh, huh/West Philly
Uh, huh/Uh, huh
Uh, huh/Uh, huh
Yo
Sing it wit' us/Love me baby
Uh, huh/Get to know us
We living La Vida Loca
You living that mediocre
We gettin' the people open
Just a breath of fresh air
Something fresh for next year
Then your deck and your bed
And your streets
And every johnny
A hooptie/A squader
A plated Benz
A Beemer/A Lex Coupe Romano
Every club every nigga
Buying drinks by the bottle
Do they thang with a model
Pleasurings like Rolo
Bang my shit to the break of dawn
And BET/Pay attention when my face is on your TV screen
And give me peace when I make a song
Then we can eat
You Burger King I'm filet mignon
So where the beef?
You mayo (Hah)
I'm Grey Poupon
You LEGO
You Play-Doh
You make me yawn
I'm Evian
My missiles hit indirect on both coast-ses
Revolution Soul Supreme are both a second to notion
I'm so hot!

[Chorus]

Blow all these bitch-ass niggas out the fuckin' water, man
What the fuck?! {*laughter*}

      How We Do it Flow
     </title>
     <lyrics>
      (*talking*)
What Boss Hogg Outlawz, uh
PJ uh, the motherfucking Rap Hustler what
Uh it's Outlaw season uh, uh what what what

[PJ]
Layed back chilling, with the mind of a G
Man these pussy ass niggaz, can't fuck with me
It's Outlaw season, bitch niggaz move around
Tuck your tail in your ass, I don't wanna hear a sound
Po' the Henn in a cup, put the lighter to the dro
PJ the Rap Hustler, yeah bitch I'm bout to blow
It's fa sho can't stop it, bank rolls in my pocket
Cadillac Coupe DeVille, speakers got the trunk knocking
Hoes bopping when we pull up, our cars are fresh
Lumivado on my wrist, big badge on my chest
Oh yes I'm a fool, please don't blow my cool
I'll cock the glock and leave that ass, in a blood pool
You know the rule shoot first, and ask questions later
Not guilty I ain't do it mayn, motherfuck a hater
Holla later back Thug, and C on the other side
Strapped up nigga what, that's how real G's ride

[Kyleon]
I got em getting bad vibes, like that award show
Cause boys know that Killa bring the heat, when I record hoe
I got a felon flow, and y'all shit's misdemeanor
I flood the beat with my speech, like Hurricane Katrina
So act like you got plex, I got a tech with me
That'll leave your shit twisted, like an evacuee
I got that work, yeah Kyleon deliver chalk
From the streets of H-Town, to the River Walk
I'm the big dog, Killa got the bigger bark
I talk cash shit, and you can hear it when a nigga talk
I'm bout a dime dollar sign, so I gotta grind
Cause being broke than a joke, is so out of line
I'm in the booth, while these other boys lazy
So when you play that boy Killa, all the dope boys go crazy
And I ain't Jeezy G, or Weezy Wee
But I'm the hottest nigga in this H-Town, please believe it G

[Hook]
This is for the G's, and this is for the hustlers
This is for the G's, and this is for the hustlers
This is for the G's, and this is for the hustlers
Out there on the grind, trying to satisfy the customers

[Yung Vahn]
Let me, introduce myself
This Yung Vahn, and dog I'm bad for your health
Might be young, but I got a lot of wealth
Talk that mess, and I'ma take off my belt
Man, I represent Texas
Where people drive wreckless, and pull up in a Lexus
Half of our people, got they name up in they necklace
It's the Dirty Dirty, y'all boys gotta respect this
Ok, I shine like chandelier
They call me MVP, I sold the rookie of the year
And I ain't got no problem, spitting that flame up in your ear
I make boys cry, mo' than a tattoo tear
Alright, I'm a G anyway
Like Burger King, cause you could have it your way
And I work in the studio, all day
It's called a freestyle, but you still gotta pay whoa

      Grown Simba
     </title>
     <lyrics>
      [Verse 1]
Now I was dreamin' bout a deal at the age of thirteen
I was fiendin' for the meals; I ain't talking Burger King
Some of my niggas in the Ville all they did was serve fiends
Fuck scales, I had skills: all day rehearsing
Them pretty boys had them gals, spend their time flirting
All they wanted was some waves like they fucking surfing
Hold up now don't get it twisted, I ain't hatin', do your thing
I was like a young Simba: couldn't wait to be the king
Now, nigga, it's the prince
Hopped over the fence, where the grass way greener
Look at shorty ass way meaner
Something like Serena mixed with Trina, have you seen her
She fine enough to be Miss Howard, word to Adina
My money like a senior watch it graduate
Now its time to eat I'm letting all my niggas grab a plate
Gravitate to real shit, stay away from phonies
These niggas heard about me now they acting like they know me

[Refrain]
Where you goin' nigga
Shit, there ain't no telling
Ay, where you goin' nigga
Ay, there ain't no telling
They keep on saying where you goin' nigga
There ain't no telling
Can't tell you where I'm goin', just know I won't stop
Goodbye to the bottom, hello to the top

[Verse 2]
Pardon the interruption
A proper introduction is necessary when your shit is legendary, man
Greedy niggas wouldn't let me in the cafeteria
Cause they ain't believe, suddenly they Presbyterian
The hoes is librarians, they looking me up
She got a jones like Marion, she licking me up
Then we cut, look how she say my name
I got her moaning J. Cole, they used to say Jermaine
I never change, I'm like a corpse in a coffin, 6 feet, shit's deep
I was low, just a dolla and some hope fixed me
Cause I was broke plus the weed that I would smoke would make it worser
Lord, please let my problems disappear like Ron Mercer
I'm a star, Converses
Conversing with them girls with them curves like cursive
They open like curtains because my shit is unheard of
Like curses on the radio
Same bitches used to play me though

[Refrain]

[Verse 3]
I left the city for a minute but it's still on my back
Told my niggas, "Ay I'm finna' put the Ville on the map"
I'll be back, and I'm coming with a deal and a plaque
Cause I'm ill bitch, they couldn't make a pill for the rap
Pouring liquor for my niggas that was killed, send em back
Came home shit is real niggas still in the trap
Hold up now don't get it twisted if you slang do your thang
Me I'm like a young Simba I can't wait to be the king
Witness the dream
Straight out that Carolina water I was brought up
In the city where the skinny niggas tryna be the ballas
Ain't no fathers but the skinny niggas tryna hit their daughters
Sneaking in her crib but her momma never caught us
What they taught us men them bad bitches only want the ballas
The starters, we hoopin' now the hoes wanna guard us
Okay, so play D - know what I mean?
And I put you on the team
Man this life is but a dream
And I need a fast car, bad broads, fast forward
Passports: I'm a fucking rap star

Chorus (4x)

[DJ Paul]
See I'm the king of the M slash C.E.O of Memphis

      [Hook]
Dis, dis, d-dis, dis, dis, d-dis
Dis, dis, dis, d-dis, dis, dis, d-dis
Dis bitch, dat hoe, hoe let me see ya pussy
Dis bitch, dat hoe, hoe let me see ya pussy

Dis bitch, dat hoe, hoe let me see ya pussy
Dis bitch, dat hoe, hoe let me see ya pussy
Dis bitch, dat hoe, hoe let me see ya pussy
Hoe, soakin' fuckin' wet

[Project Pat]
Project Pat is in this motherfucker, I know niggas hate
I know niggas wanna see me some where starvin' for a plate
Cause they bitches like to talk about us like they lick our balls
I don't never call that hoe and she love my dirty draws
I'm a North Memphis pimp so you better recognize
Let cha' hoe suck my dick while I'm lookin' in her eyes
I know y'all be tellin' lies, lyin' on ya dick ain't real
Nigga say he fucked my bitch and he couldn't wait to steal
But it's all to the goody though cause she payin' me
Free fuck for a hoody hoe, never playin' me
To the curb with my Thunderbird while I'm smokin' herb
In the tub, playa rub-a-dub I just say the word
And her pussy'll open up like a says me
I'm the first in the hood to fuck so ya praise me
Off this bitch, I'ma check her butt, I ain't lazy
Man a housewife from a slut, is ya crazy

[Hook]
Dis bitch, dat hoe, hoe let me see ya pussy
Dis bitch, dat hoe, hoe let me see ya pussy
Dis bitch, dat hoe, hoe let me see ya pussy
Hoe, soakin' fuckin' wet
Hoe, soakin' fuckin' wet
Dis, dis, d-dis, dis, dis, d-dis
Dis, dis, dis, d-dis, dis, dis, d-dis

[Ludacris]
Dis bitch, dat hoe, hoe let me see that pussy biiitch
Come through with a donation that'll make you riiich
Bigger lips on a pussy, let me see it blow a kiiiss
In the back with the yac now they blowin' on Ludacriiis
I can see it in her eeeyes
Gave me the pussy for a burger and some friiies
And they always wonder whyyy
Cause I put em' in a room and get em' so fuckin' hiiigh
Luda, I'm so true to smokin' that stanky buddha
My panky shinin' with diamonds, my index on a Ruger
I wet these hoes in they sleep so just call me Freddy Kruger
The Boogie Man, oogie, woogie, give me that oogah, boogah
You can't deny it, no passin' by it, you gotta try it
I'm number one, public enemy power gotta fight it
I got my gun and my identity started a fuckin' riot
We havin' fun, it's some Siminese pussy, like it, buy it

[Hook]
Dis bitch, dat hoe, hoe let me see ya pussy
Dis bitch, dat hoe, hoe let me see ya pussy
Dis bitch, dat hoe, hoe let me see ya pussy
Hoe, soakin' fuckin' wet
Hoe, soakin' fuckin' wet
Dis bitch, dat hoe, hoe let me see ya pussy
Dis bitch, dat hoe, hoe let me see ya pussy
Dis bitch, dat hoe, hoe let me see ya pussy
Hoe, soakin' fuckin' wet
Hoe, soakin' fuckin' wet

[Project Pat]
You can get a room on ya free time, now that we alone
Tell that buster quit callin' you, turn off ya phone
It's the big dick monster, from the back puncher
Bang, bang, skeet, skeet, pull it out launcher
Juicy, juicy, fat, fat, cum run down ya crack
Man fuck a towel, I'ma let it shoot on her back
Ridin' Lac with the tv's, find a prostitute
Missy got this with ya bank, I'm gon' fuck with chu'
All in pursuit for a bitch with low self-esteem
(Man she say her pimp is a bitch), bitch what the fuck you mean
It could seem like I ain't strapped but it's in the holster
2-0-1 a revolvin' door or a roller coaster
Gettin' most of the game from these motherfuckin' jail walls
Hoes can't resist on these streets, hoes kissin' balls
Breakin' pimp laws, bitch that'll get cha' pimp smacked
You ain't got no cheese, oh that'll get cha' head cracked

[Repeated to fade]
Dis bitch, dat hoe, hoe

      The Good The Bad and the Desolate
     </title>
     <lyrics>
      Shanky Don Intro:
Now this one is dedicated to the good the bad and the desolated. And The
Roots crew you know them lyrically orientated program you lose in life
instantly ? we're like acid we burn you. Watch a rude bwoy now.

Black Thought:
Yo you should see some of these cats that vocalize
They get props from they local guys and try to raise
Speaching through the mic like "Yo I apologize"
They blind and wasn't as wise and fail to realize the com-
Plectual sexual side of the rhyme
When I make love to the mic the crowd respond
Your promoter love the vocal over dub when I control the club
So throw your hands up in the air show your love
We waste not the bangingest beats but make use
The Roots get you open like parachutes
Yo who in the house only deal with hip hop that's authentic?
Back to renovate your state of mind for a minute
It's I, Bad Lieutenant represent fine lye
Delphia empire fifth dynasty
Your third eye couldn't wait for you to relate to what I activate
While the fake spectate
I'm less then immpressive for beyond stressin'
And battle as a reveloutionary adolescent
But now in the present with fake masters of ceremonies yo that's phoney
You'll get capped with colonial force that of a cannon
Examinin the compact disc to start rammin'
To put the diagram in effect and get fly
On immature MC's who try
Wake 'em up outta they High School High

Shakny Don:
Yo bumbading bumdadabedang
The Roots crew boy we mash things again
Bumbading ripapadededang The Roots crew bwoy we runnin' back again
Bumbading dumdadadedang The Roots boy dem run the island
Bumbading ripadededang look ? I mash up the scene

Malik B (M-illa-tant):
I blast off the roof to prove she lay in there blazed
Enslaved by the soundwaves as the skills amaze
Insight skin type annalitic cause I live it
My ? brow pivot over your style like "give it"
The lyricism I'm contemplatinng your neighborhood or legion
Brutalize your section stalk your whole region
When you blink it's hell then you drink Sifendale
You wonder what's goin' inside of my thinkin' cells
We bomb like militias I'm trying to stack riches
Look first comes the money the power then the (?)
They all will bring you down but I Milliant the sound
With a bargaid of pirate raps that's running through your town
Surrounded by a wise dome my ledge knows horizons
I keep at a distance confused and feel cyclones
You know I'm trying to make it because I probably take it
Hustlin' stickin' pickin' it or scrape it
Tracks appeal that's why I'm trying to mack a mil
I stay sedated worth a Zantac that's a pill
It gets hectic that's why niggas try to exit
Stress relates to those who walk around protected

Shanky Don:
Yo bumbading ripadingdedingdedang
The Roots crew man dem mash up the scene
Bumbading bumdadadedang The Roots crew man is running back again
Bumbading ripadingdedingdedang
The Roots crew man them come back again
Bumbading bumdadadedang The Roots crew man they run the islang

Dice Raw:
Naw nigga what's up then? Thanks for the man outroduction
Go ask your girl inside my world is the duction
No frontin' finger on the button of destruction
Play nice like entice and keep your styles on the hush and
Step inside the illafifth dungeon
Where it smells of pungent
The underwater the brotherly lovin'
Where crabs get knocked out respect from
Brought back to the lab were the scientist will dissect 'em
The old heads sniffin' start bitchin' when we testin'
Interupting my class when my class is in session
Was when I manifestin' or come to teach a lesson
What's inside of my dome I'll have all you clones guessin'
Lets begin as the color gets tossed in with the pen
It feels good that's when you know it's a sin
Everytime I rhyme I might get charged for murder
Slicing your back with rap turn a brain into burger
Lyrically I shot with radioactive waves
Like Kolby         and Big Kev on fridays
Your styles older than dolo we on the top of ?
Claim to gettin' over but you ain't makin' quota

Shanky Don:
Bumbading bumdadadedang The Roots crew man they mash up the lane
Bumbading bumdadadedang this a poor rap boy you might not see again
Bumbading bumdadadedang The Roots crew man they run things again
Bumbading bumdadadedang Rufugee Camp step on thee scene
Bumdading bumdadadedang

      Star of the State
     </title>
     <lyrics>
      [Intro: Styles P] + (Ghostface)
Yo Vinny Idol, what do you call under the underground?
(Twin Ghost Experience!) YEAH!

[Styles P]
From a hood where niggaz is miserable
Either gon' dead you or leave you in critical
Niggaz talkin money then show me the visual
And then stand right there and get plucked like a chicken feather
Stickin up the stick-up kids, nigga I'm sick as ever
The gun is my bitch, and I bet you we stick together
Stuck like two dogs fuckin
You must be ready to die, fuckin with me like, you want somethin
Ring your bell and I have you like "Who call?"
Smack you with a bat like Pujols, bottom of the ninth
You don't wanna see me at the bottom of the pint
Rowdy, be outtie cause I'm a problem for the night
Problem for your life, leg or arm missin
I can step it up, have you doubt or your mom missin
S.P. the Ghost and I'm trom' hittin
Arm kickin anytime I'm spittin nigga just like a bomb hittin

[Chorus: Styles P] + (Ghostface)
Somebody food gettin ate (gettin ate, yeah)
Somebody gettin robbed for they plate (for they plate nigga)
You know I go hard for the cake
When it come to bein hard, I'm the star of the state (nigga what)
I'm the star - somebody food gettin ate (food gettin ate, gettin ate)
Somebody gettin robbed for they plate (robbed for they plate motherfucker)
You know I go hard for the cake (it's the Twin Ghost Experience!)
When it come to bein hard, I'm the star of the state
I'm the star

[Ghostface Killah]
Yo, yo, yo I'ma tell you how we do on the Island
Squeeze your girl ass, now what, knock your punk ass off balance
You can't come through Mickey D's, no burger no cheese
Find your head missin, do you still want the #3?
+Big Mac+, large order of 9's, no shake, we got shells
Pissin on y'all bitches like R. Kell's
And more or less staple your balls together
And light you in kerosene, melt your whole face in your sweater
You see the rubber gloves, thugs
Nervous doctors play in the E.R., still wind up pullin the plug
Cause it's a Twin Ghost Experience, flesh and spirit
We bang, even the dead listen to deadly lyrics
Make Big turn in his grave, even 'Pac can hear it
Cochran, on Dirt's death, yo they tryin to appeal it
But fuck that, all we want is the crack, the cash in bags
Come through heavy, you might get yapped; motherfucker!

[Chorus]

[Styles P]
A lot of niggaz hoped I would die young
Pitched in the hood hard, want me to Cy Young
Real sharp words, guess I got me a fly tongue
Always get high cause I feel high-strung
I don't buy jewels, I buy haze and I buy guns
Or they "hear me now" like the dude from Verizon
Look at my eyes son, you won't see the next horizon
Kickin that typical rap, despicable rap
Or to get a hawk in your face, clip in your back
Guess who, still keep the thing in the sweatsuit
Hot blood leakin out your face is the best soup
Food in the kitchen nigga, shit in the restroom
Wreck when it's wreck time, S.P. the Ghost is five star
Orders to the death when I rep mine
King and the queen die, just like chess time
If I don't kill you now I'll catch yo' ass next time

[Chorus]

      I Told You So

     <lyrics>
      [Chorus: Girl + (Chino XL)]
Girl that's a fly nigga (I told you so)
Daddy come up with the rhyme nigga (Yo, I told you so)
Lyrically he crucifies niggaz (Yo, I told you so)
Chino's here, bye bye niggaz, ha hah! (Yo, check it out)
Girl that's a fly nigga (Yeah, I told you so)
Daddy come up with the rhyme nigga (Yo, I told you so)
Lyrically he crucifies niggaz (Bust it, I told you so)
Chino's here, bye bye niggaz, ha hah! (Peep it, yo, yo)

[Chino XL]
Multiplicty, out huntin my clones
Rap's turnin out more sweet proteges than Quincy Jones
My style pendergrass shoes: never touched the ground
My IQ so high it ain't no number it's a sound
I'm Jim Brown in his day, toughest nigga to tackle
I'll leave your brains hangin out like Chris Rock's adam's apple
I'm so rare, battlin Chino's like Africa:
Yeah niggaz talk about it but they don't really wanna go there
I'm hooked in leather, floored never
Create more tracks than Brandy and Monica's weaves put together
This to whoever if you rhyme like a daughter of mine
You sound like me so much I think my sperm's in your water supply
With a war to survive I slaughter and mortify
Creating a torture guy be forced and falsified
And duplicated and authorised
I autograph a girl's bra, menage-a-trois
I dont want no men in shit, let's have a women-age-a-trois

Chorus (w/ slight variations)

[Chino XL]
On everything that I love, I attack rap genres..
Fatter than Chaka Khan was
XL excederin verbal medicine sealed for tamperin
Consider me the Master P of God like Kirk Frank-lin
Shoot 'em shank 'em and burn they skin
Blast for laughs at Chino actions
Skill is a blessin you cowards could only imagine
You ain't an X-Man like comic books, you an ex-man like RuPaul
Run through y'all leave y'all stiffer than Ken dolls
You wanna start friction?  Play Don and King and..
.. end up gettin fucked like Ving Rhames in "Pulp Fiction"
My rhymes hot they just might trigger the sprinkler system
Like freaks that Eddie Murphy, call witch you comin up missin
Now you gonna listen?!  Or do I have to remind you?
I'll punch a hole through your chest
and give a pound to the man behind you
Killin you and the nigga that signed you like my Dad invented murder
I rhyme til it's a torture to me, exhaust like a catalytic converter
It's sad for me to admit I heard of, you, such a fake one
There's so many gay rappers
they probably diss me cause I'm the straight one
Plus chicks can't trick the light-skinned nigga with the long hair
With Nick Cage in an airplane these hoes couldn't +Con Air+

Chorus (w/ slight variations)

[Chino XL]
Yo, yo, you wanna raise up?  Now that takes bravery
I house niggaz like light-skinned-ed Africans durin slavery
I detonate crazily, a bomb, military can't disable me
So loose in the cypher I got Lucifer ashamed of me
Fuck who you proclaim to be, better reconsider
Turned on wrestlin and Goldberg was like "Chino that's a big nigga"
I died a thousand deaths to possess skills such as this
With delivery like where Arabs live: in-tents/intense
Sliding in events riding inside of limos with tints
Been rhyming since Timberland trees were seeds; Burger King was Prince
Better run for the fence, click clack on all you rats
I shoot blindly like I'm Ray Charles with loaded gats
(Shit) The fact is, I'm one of them crazy half-black kids
Like Jesus in the army but I earn my stripes like zebras
Without the H.I.V. I'm positive you don't wanna test
I leave rappers confused like homeless cats on house arrest

      This shit is not a fuckin game

Chorus 2X
Pac man, y'all niggas know my name
It'll take a quarter key to survive in my game
They call me Pac man, and ain't a damn thing change
Even though I got signed I'ma still slang thangs

Verse 1
Ay yo I cop power pellets (and y'all call 'em bricks)
I make little dots (and y'all chop rocks to flip)
Before junior, they had me out on a chase
Running from these ghost monsters y'all calling the jakes
All I do is stack loot
Run around and eat fruit
And harass these lady cops named Pinky and Sue
My whole life been a maze in a chase
Can't keep still without these monsters on my back invadin my space
I got two hitmen that'll bury U brothers
They rule the underworld
U know'em as the Mario brothers
Straight cannons
And won't hesitate to shoot U
And they stay goin to war wit that latin King Koopa
I got a worker named Frogger
When I say jump he leap
A highway boy who be runin the streets
Wit that package
Dodgin through traffic that's narrow
And my nigga Donkey Kong bringin weed in by the barrels

Chorus 2X

Verse 2 (Missing Verse)

I take over blocks section by section
Shake under cover cops and make 'em change direction
They best bet is to relax and chill
Sonic couldn't catch me I'm good at track and field
I might run up in your spot
When I'm runnin' from the cops
Sling work a Dime a dot
A hundred a rock
I give out cooked
Yeah But I only get raw
And I keep a nice stash in case I have a Pitfall
I got a worker named turtle that be movin my snow
He bring strait dough
He just move it too slow
I don't fuck with them crabs I had to blast those boys
I caught them breakin down my rocks like asteroids
Met ms. pac told she could go on a mission
But first she got to let me put in pole position
I wish I woulda knew then what I now know sooner
Cause 10 towns later here come pac Jr.

Chorus 2X

Verse 3

I got drugs for every race, color, and creed
I sling mushrooms to white boys in club Centipede
Donkey Kong was gettin money from slinging weed
I don't know why he wanna start a pie factory
We can be partners
That's murda, us connecting
Wit the right blow
And Burger Time doing the cheffin
We can get doe
Can't let the cops catch us
And if it move slow (still stack blocks like tetris)
Whoever don't wanna get down, they stupid
Not the one to jump around these blocks like Q-bit
Ain't nobody out there making no noise
Wit they own route but that nigga Paper Boy
We can take his stuff
He ain't tough he a nut
He always letting Dig Dug pump em up
I pull a plug on 'em niggas if they don't wanna set it
Game over niggas, I'll see you next credit

      U Don't Wanna Be Broke
     </title>
     <lyrics>
      (talking)
Check it, brrrrrow!
That was personal!
It's real with this
I came here right now to put a little hope in the hearts,
and the minds of those have-nots

You don't wanna be broke, you wanna be rich and famous
(Bad Azz is a fool)
well why would you go where everybody knows what your name is
(Bad Azz is a fool)

[Verse 1]
I'm a product of the block
selling crumbs off this fifty dollar rock
and my house is the dope spot
on the couch with the door locked
Shorty K's on the phone, Lil J's on the floor
the Jeffersons on the tube somebody knockin at my door
who is it?
I aint expectin no visit
so shady, I answer the door with the 380
cuz lately, haters been pushing my buttons
frontin niggas get nothin
it's like all of the sudden
everybody's want a Bentley
everybody got a rap
everybody done been in a gang or sold a little crack
How's that?
for history on Unsolved Mysteries
you niggas wanna holla at Bad, you can get with me
in traffic I'm a hood-type nigga made good
I'm the chronic wit it, stress weed tastes like wood
and you should, recognize life is more important
every second that goes by, it's only getting shorter
we order death at the burger stand
murder stands closer to love than hate, wait
drugs are more abundant than fate
and there some places about as safe as being nowhere
close to your gun out in Kosovo
run on feet from the cops,
with the lights from the chopper on your back
ditch the strap, with the other hand throw the sack
if they catch me without the gun they gon' stretch me
fuck a six, I'd rather deal with God and repent
and on this one way street of life that ends in the middle
there's a little time left, let's hit the liquor store and get some liqour nigga
drink away the drama before it leads us astray
wake up drunk and do the same thing the very next day
and aye aye
if I cane I aint got enough money honey
real sunny days make me horny, do you want me
to spend a little money on your panties and a movie and some candy with some doobie and some brandy, and he
took her to the hotel
to whoop her and let her throw tail
all around the room, and check out about noon
to zoom zoom
and I smashed off
just to drop the ass off
and turn the beat up, and speed up
cuz this the type of shit that niggas thrash on

(chorus)

You don't wanna be broke, you wanna be rich and famous
(Bad Azz is a fool)
well why would you go, where everybody knows what your name
(Bad Azz is a fool)
I can see you don't know, exactly what the game is
(Bad Azz is a fool)
I'm just trying to give you hope, that's exactly what my aim is
(Bad Azz is a fool)

[Verse 2]
In this forsaken life of sin
they got a cell for you waiting at the pen
your homies is there, that aint never coming back again
it's silly murders in the dope game
robbed and executed over cocaine
from Little Rock on back up to Spokane
and L.A.'s the same thang
the same place the kids play they gang bang
they bang bang and shoot em up
and who the fuck!
got heart enough to talk to a pistol
blow the whistle on your life
it's like craps on the dice
bustin' caps on a bike
flee speedin down an alley
thinking 'Damn!  It's somethin bout Cali'
It's water or the Cavi
naw maybe it's the bitches and the sunshine
fool it's the palm trees, cool breeze and one time
This the home of ragtops and swimsuits
we wear Chuck Taylors, nigga we don't fuck with Timb boots
We 2pac wit it (what)
We too hot wit it (what)
Keep two glocks wit em (what)
shoot two cops wit em (what)
we on the block wit it
raw, nonstop wit it
run up bustin', nigga cuz we aint cockin shit
We in the chamber off safety
you in danger if you hatin all that envy and that drama really make me
wanna take it there, make it wear
you aint really safe out here
Comin up on your block
poppin shots out the drop
Snatch my ski mask off, turn the beat up
and speed up, cuz this the shit that niggas thrash on

(Chorus)

Bad Azz is a fool (repeated until end)

[Sole']
It could be 4, 5 or 6, you bet' not be nowhere laid up wit no bitch
You betta bring that home to momma, don't be playin and shit
If you get horny when you out, no need for eyein' them hoes
Why eat a burger when you got steak and potatoes at home?
A short drive is all it takes, I'm just a phone call away
Ain't no excuses mutha fucka for you runnin astray
I give it to you when you want it aint no other's like mine
Yo ex-bitch can't fuck with this, so don't be wastin' yo time
The Indian, black mix, boy like I told you before
And we can ay yi yi  the fur rug  on my living room floor
And ain't nan hoe gon' bring it like you know I'mma bring it
And ain't nan hoe gon' freak it like you know I'mma freak it
And ain't nan hoe gon' shake it like you know I'mma shake it
And aint nan hoe gon' take it like you know I'mma take it
So don't make me come lookin for you, pull you outta some mix
Then turn around and bust you in yo shit for 4, 5 or 6

1 - [Kandi]
I don't care if it's 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 in the morning
Boy you better call me when you think you gettin horny
I don't give a damn bout who you with
Just as long as you aint givin up my shit

Repeat 1

[JT money]
You know me as your player, your pipe layer, your all night stayer
All up in your sauce when you need your rocks off
Knock your socks off, baby off the chain in this bitch
Have your wide ass open while I'm slangin' this dick
Got you lovin' this shit, suckin and fuckin this dick
Wanna go and make some bucks for this dick
Fightin' all in the club for this dick
I'm that player that you chose
Long as you satisfied, baby fuck them other hoes
Just keep my pussy horny so you can put it on me
Girl you know I'm the only one who can satisfy your monkey
Ain't nobody gon' do you like I do when I put this love stick inside you
Money man guaranteed to satisfy you
Have you open all night like a drive-through
So bring yo thang on so I can get my bang on
I hope you likes a good fuck because my game strong
And I ain't lyin' girl you wouldn't if you could quit
I signs my name on that pussy, Mr. Good Dick
That's my shit

Repeat 1
Repeat 1

[Sole']
Now nigga what you gone do, ugh, let me put this good lovin on you
We can do everything that you want to
'Cause I like it real freaky, nigga don't you
That's right, don't make no promises
Can't find none better than mommas is
Stay wet, stay tight, keep you comin' back
Go all night feelin' right, you be lovin that
Hell yeah, like wanna make enough moves
Fuckin you boy like I got something to prove
Runnin loose, fuck it nigga gotta pay dues
Make you wanna tell ya boys all about whose
No talkin' now, come get the good shit
Make you never wanna fuck another hood bitch
Have ya breakin' off plans to come and lay me
Mutha fucka, don't ever try and play me

Repeat 1 to fade

     <lyrics>
      * send corrections to the typist

[Background] "I see the horizon the Grate Unknown"

[Ruck]
I'm telling you man cut it out
Yo...we embarked on this nocturnal excursion in order to exchange
Conversation with these mortals not to play games
For real behind every great Ruck theres a Rock
The Rockness Monsta.....Dutch

[Rockness Monsta]
Yo its the Rockness not Rock live
Then again I'm Rock when I'm live
But I'm not fat then again my shit is so fat
fans let your shot's fly (PLOW! PLOW! PLOW!)
Swift and changeable no style, be Rock style
Not foul, but play with me at your own risk and I might not smile
You get with the pawn, in one arms
I don't fight clean, flow like a butterfly, sting like a scorpion
On the tip of a sick ding-a-ling, bring the noise with your peeps
We up in this space deep, wit' nines like Star-Fleet, ah shit
God bitch ass rappers, and P I'll trap ya, then like a federal case
I'll crack ya word to my man Don Rulla, I'll cold beat your crew up
If it gets thick then number two-a, pass me the ruler
Click Click...Booya!!

[Chorus 2x]
[Rock] If you don't know like I know
Then act like you know, like I know

(Rock: I beat's more ass than mom dukes leather belta)
(Ruck:'Cause Rock make cops throw Glocks Down like Heather)

[Background] "The Grate Unknown"

[Verse Two]
I turn this upside down, clown
Watch me and you'll get the picture, if ya don't understand
Why I be the Mr. Flipster, rhyme deliverer
Nine slug through your spine, and leave you on the floor vibratin'
Like a fouled line
Find the robbies, lurking in the dark ally
With more nigga, than a motherfuckin' guard rally
Tally up all the throats, the strangler hold choke
That all the riots that my brother Ruck is provoked, don't like my style
So I don't give a WHAT, cuz you bring the beef, and the Rock
All the Rock buck you one time, so cover you by the loggins
Machete I chop that beef you pop, and feed it to my nigga doggen
Follow the trail of broken backs and, at the end of each you'll find
Me standing with my blackjack, with the Smith and Wessun on my side smoke
Another gat
(Ruck: Some Illa Noyz be the act for the attack)
Fuck you street fighter, front if you wanna get hyper
I strap on bombs and blow your face up like Stryker
Yo representatives light up another ? Spliff, while I dip, by the way
(smack) big up to the ill bitch

[Chorus 4x]

(Rock: Rockness Monsta, stomp ya, ? )
(Never changin', forever face rearangin')
(You asked for it who want beef so here's war)

[Background] 4x : I see the horizon the Grate Unknown

[Ruck] We will, we will Rock you

[Verse Three]
Question (What)
Yo, who's the crew with the juice tryin' to front (What!)
Yo money, yo life and wars all I want (What!)
Bring all beef to Bedrock I got my gun (What!)
Niggaz soft as burger buns (What!What!)
Front man shit, spit
On the grave of the weak, when I speak, my tongue is nasty as a freak
I'm in a inner state of, inner mind
Which inner twines, with my inner body now I'm energizes
Its an insane shame, you can ask Ricky Steen
Order b-cheese be sweatin' ,no shorties only gettin' green
BLING! the sound then ? ghost, gone, me and Sean
Your shit's now paid for the Tron, need I go on you damn right
I'm foul as fuck, so if I should go to the line and shoot two (ah, shit duck)
Like James Bond I shoot to kill, Heltah Skeltah's here
Try square with me, clean a man like Mr. Belvedeere
Born in a place so far away it's prehistoric, Bedrock
No regular man survive that ? , from the age of stone
To the age of chrome, from Bedrock to Bucktown my fuckin' names known

[Chorus 4x]

(Rock: Military Punisher Rock MP)
(Manson punishin' and keep robbing like Danville)
(Scar on my face but I'm not Al Pacino)
(Run for your guns me and self comin' through, Heltah Skeltah)

[Ruck] We will, We will

[Rock] We will Rock you, motherfuckin' knock you..

[Ruck] Beats more western mom do ?
From the land of the darkness Heltah Skeltah....We will, We will rock
You...Word is Born

      Body

     <lyrics>
      (Funky)
(Down)

[ VERSE 1: Boogie Knight ]
The body consists of sexy things
Including the skin, for all eyes to behold
There are shoulders and thighs, butts and you-know-whats
Stories about the body that are never told
Like a story about Mary, she almost died
From a disease her body had inside
She lost her boyfriend, poor thing, she cried
Didn't tell anyone, had too much pride
And it all came out on the body outside
Body, yes, the body, able to take a big brainiac
And make him get involved in that love
Get him all infatuated, saying things he don't mean
Cause body love isn't what love's made of
Heard a story about a girl they called Joanne
Homegirl's doin bad, she couldn't understand
Till a brother with juice, known as G Man
Pulled the girl to the side and he said, "Joanne
You really ain't got no man
All he cares about is his hands
All over your body"
Body, body, body, body (body)
All the girls got dogged, that's unheard
They said, "Joanne, you'se a bit regular"
So she gave to the game, pumped weights
And now she's got a body
Gave her body up to somebody
Who treats her like she's a nobody
And he also told everybody
"Joanne's a big freak, she loves when I serve her body"
Well, well, well, that sounds just like
A place you might call dirty
I'm Boogie Knight and while you're at the party
Rock your body till about 5:30
I'm talkin bout the body

Body, body, body, body
(B-b-b-b-body)
Body, body, body, body
(B-b-b-b-body)
(Nasty)
Body, body, body, body
(B-b-b-b-body)
Body, body, body, body
(Hey)

[ Romeo JD ]
When walkin down the street you know my girl gets mad at me
Because I'm checkin out another girl's anatomy
I tell her, "Baby, I don't deserve this
She bent over and she did it on purpose"
My girl's pissed and she walks away
Ha, but I'm chillin for the rest of the day
Hey, when I'm alone, though, I must say
Yo, the def bodies never come my way
Like in a composition, if you can't recall
You know the body used to be the best part of it all
When you're shoppin for a car if you're shoppin for the body
You wouldn't get a Jetta, you would get a Maserati
Am I right? (Sho you right) I know, you don't have to say it
Anybody with a body's on a mission to display it
Swerves and curves, both short and tall
You been buyin your pants two sizes small
Health spas takin all the fly girls' salaries
Summertime's comin, got to lose those calories
Excercise like it ain't no thing
And not the 100 yard dash to the Burger King
Cause when it comes to the body you shouldn't be fessin
Your body is the part that gives the first impression
So next time you come to a Boogie Boy party
If you can't come lean come clean cause we'll be checkin out your (body)

Body, body, body, body
(B-b-b-b)
(Nasty)
Body, body, body, body
(B-b-b-b-b-b-body)
Body, body, body, body
(Body)
Body, body, body, body
(Body)
(Body)
1, 2, 3 and -
(Everybody)

      Jersey
     </title>
     <lyrics>
      (Queen Latifah)
Yo what's up this is Queen Latifah in the house
Definetely representin Jersey on the love love
Coolin' in the county; shoot (???)
But damn I miss home

[Chorus 4X]
I can't.. forget New Jersey

(Verse 1: Queen Latifah)
When I think of home I think of a place where theres no over-flowin
And all my family and peeps I knew when I was growin
Mommy and daddy made me proud to in Owens
So for me to keep goin, I would become
Her eminental royal highness
The Queen Latifah; no doubt; one of New Jersey's finest
So, said it all
Get up on all of my own
Cause Jersey's what I think about when I think of home
Don't let know one get close to you except the chosen
Stick with the ones who meant the most to you
when you were broke and blue, that's how fam do
That's how you stay true around these snakes
that freakin' smile when they hate you
I'm quick to take the ride down for in-town
(Just another day living on a down)
My experience legit, my rhymes is on hit
It's mad truth to the room where we the shit; I can't forget

[Chorus]

(Verse 2: Queen Latifah)
I used to work at Burger King but after takin orders
I used to take the path to Latin Quarters across the waters
Where I learned to do the Who, yo, I couldn't stop
I brought it back around the way to show the peple on my block
Teacher, teacher, tell me how you do it
It looks so simple like that there's nothin to it
So, we meet at Irvan's (???) and after school I run
To the wall of Brookmore boots, there was Solamon
I had a talent for getting up for gear
A petty thief, small time crook of the year
But I chilled cause I had bigger dreams than to steal
And Ramsey came for me and Patchy to put our voices on a reel
And I could hear myself on the radio
"45 King Special Red Alert Show"
Cause that's what life was all about to me
All E-E flavor you did it, represent Jersey

[Chorus]

(Verse 3: Queen Latifah)
I think about my mom and my brothers when I'm all swoll
Shock, Kim, when I'm all swoll
My baby sister. when I'm all swoll
Hostan, when I'm all swoll
Ill-Town, when I all swoll
Jill-Town, J.C, when I'm all swoll
(???) to (???) so on, when I'm all swoll
Recognize the whole mama soul
We got Naughty
In another words we got Nicky
We got Redman, the Order Facts and Whitney (???)
Bruce Springsteen, and a house ah blacks
Shaquille O'Neal, oh he'll catch rack
Tisha Campbell, Jerry Lewis, Tony Bennett
Back spin, or spin it,
Thursday peppermint and I'm in it
Shag do's, I does no fo's in the spot
Cause them peeps is my peeps and my back is got
Nuf' respect to your burough, your block
You're black; I love to see us move as a flock
Unscrapped, against each other
No body armor
Nobody harms a hair on a head, everything calmer
We ghetto stars and fools
We paid the dues
We made the blues
So come on with the come on
And get down with the get down
I'm down with my hometown sound

[Chorus]

      DTP for Life
     </title>
     <lyrics>
      [Chorus: I-20]
It's some real niggaz here, it's some real niggaz here
It's some real, it's some real, it's some real niggaz here
It's some real niggaz here, it's some real niggaz here
All the time we steady screamin' DTP for life!

[Verse 1: I-20]
It's clear who on top dawg, I guess I ain't supposed to count
A 1/4 mill before the deal, my wife was spendin' most of that (yeah!)
Niggaz buy the bar out, thinkin' they could hang with us
FUCK it Chaka, buy the club 'cause we brought some change with us
But if my money wasn't straight, I'd go right back &amp; rob a nigga
I'm tryna get that Maybach &amp; goin' back to maul the nigga!
The glock will scare most niggaz, but some will try to act hard
SK-32, call that shit my black card!
&amp; everybody want somethin' you can bet yo' life on it
Some hoes will try to give you head, others put a price on it
I-Dub, young dealer, know the name &amp; take it down
Extacy to cocaine, bag it up &amp; break it down
&amp; yeah this might surprise you, you are being lied to
FUCK if he real I need some shit that I can ride to
Bang bang, shoot 'em up, nigga that's the motto here
Livin' fo' today 'cause you might not see tomorrow here

[Chorus: I-20] Repeat 2X

[Lil' Fate talking in background]
Tell 'em, tell 'em!!! Yeeah (yeeah), look

[Verse 2: Lil' Fate]
I ain't gotta try dawg, I can get gangsta too
The ground'll be Blood red, your face'll be Crip blue
Can of whoop-ass I'ma open soon as I spot you
For talkin' all that bullshit off in them interviews
We ain't gotta rob you, we gettin' money over here
No album dropped, still shawty is a millionaire
Put a price on your head if you wanna take it there
Funeral, front row, mama cryin' +Right Thurr+
+Jackpot+ took shots and got dropped all because
He was poppin' off at the mouth like a hoe does
Bitch you can't expose us, naw it ain't no love
When you see us in the streets act like you don't know us
Slim said, "Don't let up!" so I had to stay on him
Just to set the record straight - this is Lil' Fate, homie
Only use if you or don't know me to light up the streets
Better watch your words when you talkin' 'bout Disturbing Tha Peace

[Chorus: I-20] Repeat 2X

[Verse 3: Ludacris]
Hailin' from Blacklanta Metropolis &amp; hangin' on the block with us
You don't need laser vision to see it ain't no FUCKIN' stoppin' us
Keepin' a gang of niggaz that be layin' down that murder game
Get that ass flame broiled, you SWEAR we worked at Burger King
Swervin' mane, up and down the block
Rock, steady cops
Heavy on the booty of that Chevy please BELIEVE ME!
Sippin' on that 'Nac
I'm ready to put a nigga on his belly or his back
'Cause we ain't goin' down EASY!
&amp; that's if we go down at all, I'm quick to throw down &amp; brawl
I'll punch a hater in his throat for talkin' nonsense (blah!)
&amp; we won't back down at all until you back down and fall
So tell Osama DTP's about that bomb shit (blah!)
We convicts like Akon &amp; Young Jeez
I can blow you off the map with two grips &amp; one squeeze (aaahhh!)
Just for walkin' on my turf you pay fees
Or get a bullet to yo' teeth, tell these boys to say, "CHEESE!!!"

[Chorus: I-20] Repeat 2X

      Carry On
     </title>
     <lyrics>
      [Intro: Shyheim, sample]
"Is that any way for a man to carry on, carry on
carry on" - sample repeated throughout intro
Mister education, I'm on my way, let's go, uh huh
Ask yourself, if you was me, yeah, carry on, but you
ain't got now

[Shyheim]
Layin' in my cell, starin' at the ceiling, oh what a fucked up feeling
The things that I used to adore, I no longer find appealing
And the girl I loved so much, she started exhaling
While I was jailing, my niggaz turned the other cheek
So I stopped calling, I sensed they ain't wanna speak
I couldn't go to sleep, no one to hug but my sheets
Kept bangers for the beef, that follow me from the street
Dear mama, I wrote you a letter, why you ain't write back?
Must of went right back, to the pipe and crack
If it wasn't for grandma, I would of been hung up
But I heard her voice in my head, tellin' me to be tough
I put the sheet back on the mattress, where the fuck is my matches
When I need a cigarette, you ain't feelin' my pain yet
So, anybody, everybody, somebody, please
Tell me, is this any way?

[Chorus 2X: sample]
"Is that any way for a man to carry on, carry on carry on
Oh oh... yeah..., carry on"

[Shyheim]
Last night I couldn't sleep, I tossed and turned
Heard hell was hot and dark, and the fire really burns
My lawyer firm, couldn't get this day to germ
So I'm sittin' on the edge of the bed, I lit a C, I journed
Took a deep inhale, blew out the smoke, like fuck it kid
It is what it is, I'mma die in jail
And for my last million, you know the God, from the mob ate spaghetti
Soon as I birthed, the C.O. jerked "Franklin, you ready?"
I guess so, he like 'let's go', my comrade next go
Scream "hold your head, babe bro", Yeah yeah
See you when you get there, I'mma have it crackin'
For every G mackin', in this sad fashion, we started laughing
The funny thing was, it wasn't nothin' funny
At the end nothing matters, the God,drugs or the money
I'm shackled bashful, walking down the corridor
Chains draggin' on the floor, I said a prayer for all of y'all

[Chorus 2X]

[Shyheim]
Seven four pound, I'm wakin' up to a count
Washed my face, brushed my teeth, rinsed my mouth
My super three, blastin' ODB off the meter
And I sip a cup of Folgers, fresh off the stinger
Got my greens on, sittin' with my feet up
Waitin' on the porter, to bring my feed up
Cuz yesterday, in the fish tank, a bitch nigga got ate
And beat up, I'm blowin', stick after stick
But stayin' on my water game, avoiding the dirty dick
I ain't rich, I don't spit on no home for nigga's chicks
Stay in my gangsta pose, like every move I make false, click click
You can catch Shy in transit, with my eyes open
Scopin' out for my bandits, it better be more careful
Like the book written by Shannon, I never signed in
Got disciplinary record, that Flex can't even split
I'm a soldier, I thought I told ya
My rep rap in the kept, like seven up, not the soda
I stopped at Wendy's, but it wasn't for a burger
I'm a Clinton hub thug, and the green bloods get no love
And in Marcy, I really see niggaz cough up a lung
But I'm really tryin' to chill, get closer to home
And God forget, the fish kill, yea, I'm that real deal

Either me or my boys tore it up before
But I'm hoping you not that type

Some say off the liquor you could fuck all night (fuck all night)
But I say that ain't true you just be drunk all night (drunk all night)
It's me when I'm sober I can fuck all night
Baby girl if we sipping we just drunk all night
It's cool, first you gotta loose your attitude
Invite your girls over let 'em meet my man Murder
We smoke, talk, get aquainted
It's get low so you know you gotta sing this
Whatever happened tonight
Trust it got to stay between us
It never happened tonight so when they ask you
Say you never seen us (bitch)
Then me and Murder get ghost in the convertable
We just came from Fat Burger we full
Thats how we do it in LA from Marcy to Crenshaw
The girls all balls huhhh

[Chorus]
Why you mad and acting uptight
Girl I know that something ain't right
Ain't no need for me to lie
I think that you need dick in your life
Why you mad and acting uptight
Girl I know that something ain't right
Ain't no need for me to lie
I think that you need dick in your life

[Nate Dogg]
When your additude is gone
You can hit me on my phone
And maybe I'll come get you
Get up and take you home
Girl dont take too long
Just like a dog I like to roam
So when you need some dick
Hit me on the hip and I'll do you that favor

[Memphis Bleek]
Listen, anytime you need me just holla
I'll only hit it if its tight and its proper
The snatch ups no problem
Both of that head drop fitted caps
Now a days they gotta
You get it snatched you never get it back
Something just ain't right you must ain't kill it right
But, go ahead love just enjoy your night
Get your man off your mind
You need me in your life thats right

[Chorus]
Why you mad and acting uptight
Girl I know that something ain't right
Ain't no need for me to lie
I think that you need dick in your life
Why you mad and acting uptight
Girl I know that something ain't right
Ain't no need for me to lie
I think that you need dick in your life

      Charlie Mack (1st Out of the Limo)
     </title>
     <lyrics>
      [Fresh Prince]
Everywhere we go, downtown or to a show
We have two necessities, Charlie Mack and our limo
He's feared by suckers yet he's loved by kids
Pay attention and let me tell you who Charlie Mack
He is our homeboy from around the block
He's regarded through the city as the hip-hop cop
Height about 6'6", weight about 290
Everywhere I go, Charlie Mack is right behind me
He never laughs, never smiles nor sweats
He doesn't breaks arms or legs, only spines or necks
He once KILLED a man cause he would not let go of his Eggo
Apollo Creed is a SUCKER, Charlie Mack could beat Drago
He could bench about three-hundred pounds
The cops all take a vacation, when Charlie's in town
He's the toughest around, so everywhere that I go, he goes
He's Charlie Mack and he's the first out the limo

[Fresh Prince]
I guess you're wonderin why he's the first out
the limo, yo, let me give you this bit of info
so you'll know the things that Charlie can do
and you'll know every single reason why he's down with the crew
The limo picks up about a half past six
With the radio blastin our latest hit
It's me, Jeff, Ready Rock, Omar and J.L.
Charlie Mack is up front as we depart the hotel
First we cause chaos throughout the city streets
Then maybe stop at Burger King for a bite to eat
And if somebody gets stupid while we're in the place
Charlie cancels his order and bites off their face
He's not a troublemaker, in fact, he's a troublebreaker
And if somebody gets dumb, well it'll only take a
second or two, after some fools snaps
Law and order is restored by my hero Charlie Mack
Wheel off into the limo, and head for the jam
Charlie cracks all the knuckles, on both of his hands
And when we pull up to the show, the routine is unrehearsed
It's just natural that we let Charlie hop our first
He clears the crowd without sayin a word
Man, that's the loudest silence I've ever heard
A lot of times guys test him, by tryin to bug
He just, leaves ring imprints, all over their mugs
He's a terminator, a Hercules of sorts
Man to hell with chess, he likes physical sports
You may not have known before but now you know
the reason why Charlie Mack is the first out the limo

[Fresh Prince]
We'd like to apologize to all of our fans
but please don't touch us when we're at our jams
Cause Charlie don't like folks around us when we're doin a show
And if he punches you, uh-oh, better get Maaco!
Still you weak rap dudes tempers are hot
just because I've got somethin that YOU AIN'T GOT
If you want to get physical, rowdy or try to bomb me
I won't get excited, I'll just say, "Yo Charlie!"
You shoulda been kind, you shouldn't have snapped
Charlie only hits you once and now you're takin a nap
And when he leaves you decaptitated, crushed in the dust
you'll look up, and see your girl in the limo with us
You may think that's enough boy but I think not
Charlie kick his face again I think you missed a spot
I roll down the limo window and yell, "By the way Eyes
you'll see your girl bucknaked givin Charlie a message"
I'm serious, I'm not jokin, no doubt
You know how many doubters bones have been broken
You may not have known before but now you know
the reason why Charlie Mack is the first out the limo

[Fresh Prince]
Charlie Mack.. the first out the limo
He's Charlie Mack.. the first out the limo

In closing, we'd like to say this, to you bustaz
If you're skeptical you'll probably get beat up, plus kid
embarassed and laughed at, by all of your friends
And if you cross Charlie Mack it's the beginning of the end
of life as you know it, you might not die, sir
But if you're not dead, you'll wish you were
But if you still wanna bug out, homeboy let's go
You can bug with Charlie Mack cause he's the first out the limo

He's Charlie Mack
and he's the first out the limo

      Pillow Fulla Scrilla
     </title>
     <lyrics>
      Ya...Ladies I'm Back
Got What You Need...Got You Ready
I Want You To Fluff My Pillow For Me

I'm out wandering, watching while you're looking bored
Rappable powers, half my life is on record
Where the record shopper for anal swap meet cats
Or pulling off the rigid panties from your young auntie
Entrepeneur maneuver, rappers, Inspector Gadget
Pager digits for slim, honies who got the money
Gang flipping magician, you call me David Blaine
Sex first is worth my girl, peep that yellow skirt
Deranged sexual launch, short of a comic
Cookies and milk, honey's pussy felt like warm silk
I bought the coffee maker, listen to Janet Jackson
Food in Tampa, the beach, was it really happening
Sweet G went to Vegas to check the burger joint
Emergency, beautiful sandwich with the handle shit
Calculator work, I got a safe budget
Soft sofa, leather floor, fucking read the warrant
Human afternoon, A/C in the Caravan
The moral street passes shoppers, second hand meet
Partial people, drug induced, reproduced killers
I sleep on a Pillow Fulla Scrilla

"Everynight and everyday, we doing this in many ways"
Sleep on a Pillow Fulla Scrilla
"Everynight and everyday, we doing this in many ways"
Sleep on a Pillow Fulla Scrilla
"Everynight and everyday, we doing this in many ways"
Sleep on a Pillow Fulla Scrilla
"Everynight and everyday, we doing this in many ways"

Partial delivery, DJ with that care package
Actual racket makes attacks, break her backbreaker
Jawbreaker, assign all keys, super sweet tooth
Your lady blew her time with me in the vocal booth
Empty the ATM, switch account to city bank
Bank of Montreal, BLT with pickles, the waitress giggle
The '86, my deal the, was sold to get
Nowadays, I save my memories, I don't forget
I have fun as my alias, my stacks grow
Dark slacks, amtrack, I just relax bro
Stress is for the seagulls, I peep some more finesse
Making lasagna, so people can't afford a dress
My address, attached to a mellow smooth location
When it's time for vacation, ain't no Greyhound Station
I don't like to fly, but hey I do it all the time
Hit on the stewardess, is that a Valour dress

"Everynight and everyday, we doing this in many ways"
Sleep on a Pillow Fulla Scrilla
"Everynight and everyday, we doing this in many ways"
Sleep on a Pillow Fulla Scrilla
"Everynight and everyday, we doing this in many ways"
Sleep on a Pillow Fulla Scrilla
"Everynight and everyday, we doing this in many ways"

Paper enhancer, the quiet man with all the answers
My style is dreamscape, coffee with the cream cake
Casual observer, the underground rapper server
I'm not the hip-hop authority, who's a lead murder suspect
I'm slashing their careers on the torso
Didn't think it was, my nautica is hot also
Middle of the day, send me up some mellow Tony
I got melon and rappers lack if they pistol packing
That's if they forget to call, but won't it happen slowly
She'll come back, she cut off, strut off, end of story
Triple my D-head, welcome to my seargeant's honey
More of some sweet G, from here to Boston dummy
Mammal is durable, expression of executiveness
Buy some land, eat a porno tape and dry my hand
Lottery luck, Lauterdale sipping Gerry Hill
Canada Dry, amateur born looking in the hill
Antoinette suck my sweat plus my clarinet
I go to K-Mart, fuck around and hit the strip
Most exciting got you fingernail biting
For real, I sleep on a Pillow Fulla Scrilla

"Everynight and everyday, we doing this in many ways"
Sleep on a Pillow Fulla Scrilla
"Everynight and everyday, we doing this in many ways"
Sleep on a Pillow Fulla Scrilla
"Everynight and everyday, we doing this in many ways"
Sleep on a Pillow Fulla Scrilla
"Everynight and everyday, we doing this in many ways"

      Day by Day

     <lyrics>
      Niggaz want me to help 'em
I can't help myself
Want me to support them
I can't support myself
Want me to know you
I barely know myself
I might got a little fame
I ain't got no wealth
I'm just one man and one sinner
Living on big gulps and healthy choice dinners
You can tell that I'm stressed
Hear it in my voice
But this is my life man
Rapping is my choice
And I bet you that I make it
Put my life on it
Unborn seed, my crib, and my wife on it
My mics on it w/ bodies of dead friends
That I lost as a child and never will see again
Unless it's at the crossroads
Where heaven and hells home
And niggaz that give you that call
Don't mean the cell phone
Do your research like stem cell clones
And the odds are stacked
Just like Ida B Wells Home

[Chorus]

From the small talk, my words
It's only meant for big things
So I settle for nothing less then the big screen
I got dreams but I ain't Dr. King
Want to make freedom ring
Wouldn't mind a pinky ring
What's wrong with having nice things
Shit, back in Africa wearing the gold was a sign of a king
Naledge just a sign of the times
Every line in my rhyme define off the top of the mind
I'm one of a kind
Southside's finest
a.k.a. your Heiness
Like airport laboratories
I keep fly shit
16 bars if you wanted to try shit
Microphone Mike Vick, I'm a game breaker
Wack mc's shake sorta like a salt shaker
Y'all niggaz just fakers
I'm singing Anita Baker
In the background is the rapture
Y'all niggaz actors

[Chorus]

I remember back when we used to cipher in the basement
It was me, Bradley, and Fooch, Woody, and little David
And nobody ever thought that we would make it
Now them same people hitting me saying my joints they favorite
I ain't going rub it in
But I can't lie, cuz I'm loving it
Sorta like the burger commercials
Niggaz home keep asking if I'm turning commercial
I said nah, I'm trying to turn to underground universal
And I meant a couple A&amp;R's from Universal
Shady, def jam, sent a nigga walking like Hershel
I understand, it's nothing personal
But personally I don't give a flying fuck if Halle had a set of wings
To my favorite? filled dreams
On stage I vent steam
Show money, got money in European jeans
In Japan
We're just eating on sushi
Waiting to hear cut swimmer like it's a movie

[Chorus] followed by talking

My words run deep like a skinny girls cut
From a habitat to battle raps, 40 ounces, and blunts
Deep dish pizza, chicken wings, public transportation
Through raps I receive emancipation
I used to get teased like you wouldn't believe
Black kids called me white just because I could read
White kids called me strange cuz of my African name
Now they say my rhymes flame
It's funny how times change
Money makes the world go round
Hustle make the hoes come round
Turns a snakes frown upside down
Eyes on the prize keep my ears low to the ground
Head to the sky like my words came from the clouds
Life's a bitch
Shacking like I play for the Heat
Put a mattress in a snare how I lay in the beat
And it's oh so serious, oh so delirious
Nigga turn this up fuck is you hearing this

(Talking)

Clutching a beer
Wishing my nigga Raleigh was here
Feeling like Jermaine Taylor as I'm fighting the tears
Wishing I could speak to 'em
Throw a beat to 'em
Now I just look to the sky I think I speak through him
18 years 18 years
Now I'm looking at his momma pour his ash in the pier
Life moving too fast
And I'm losing my peers
That's why I rap so hard, there's nothing to fear
Drinking hard liquor even when there's nothing to cheer
Here comes a brand new flavor in your ear
Not Craig Mack but pro black
My flow is on Prozac
Like Cuba boy in the hood but never go back
That's how I know that
A nigga got to stay strong
Just got to make it like Twista and Trey Songz
Too many times in my life seen niggaz stray wrong
Now I'm determined to never play the same song

      Tell Dat to Dummies

     <lyrics>
      "Always admired your ability to communicate precisely"

[Equipto Talking]
Yeah, shit, you know I mean
We in slow motion with it mayne
All my homeboys give a little bit of stuff to ????
You know I'm sayin, little club, for medical use only
Some of that official shit, you know?
It's yo' boy 'Quipto

[Equipto]
-Hmm, yeah
I'm the new Jack Nino, on my own like Cee-Lo
Got carried away married to this game when I eloped
Gone, I'ma take it further I learn her soon as I turn her
Out, and there'd be no doubt that she'll be flippin' like a burger
Now, I'm just a two steppin', Hugh Heffen
Gotta watch for these groupies puflukes just to get you naked
But I'ma spit it, rap it, 'til a young cat livin' lavish
Yo' homeboy it's a scratch it, I tell 'em get established
Lean back, jump off how they react
Picky for strictly just for the sticky like a tree sap
Trixie got them knee pads
I let the beat blast, time is money
'Til then just miss me spit them lies to dummies
I'm genuine, Bettison, practice on my etiquen
Represent the president Edison, feel to the elements
Huh, you feelin' trapped like a rat in a race
But slappin' five 'cause a true rap cat in the place
Blow the purple, if not baby walk like Herschel
She could walk, run, long jump, hurdle
Just leave the circle, back on the blade after mackin on stage
Don't hate 'cause I'm just jack of all trades
Tradin' places with me, you livin' days like a week
Every single toes on you feet
Gone put she work in them streets
The co-co-concrete, I got a plan is get in and get out
And all my homeys know what I'm talkin' about, t-t-t-thizz out

[Andre Nickatina]
Man I'm classified a spitter in the game
I get the issue and the tissue and don't cry about the fame
I spit a dart right through your heart and see my life 'll come apart
I like to party in the dark, so baby how you gonna start
The music's loud, I kick it live, and it's a federal surprise
Time after time you open wide and my reflection's in your eyes
It's like the liquor on the counter, making money by the hour
Gettin cleaner than the shower, standing up just like a flower
Get the flavor for the fantasy you know it's me I'm greedy
No more hidin in the clubs because the bitches say they see me
I be chewin' on a Doublemint sometimes a Spearamint
I say I got a bottom, but the hoes ain't hearin' it
I talk a lot of shit man spit the mix man flavor in this rhyme
I seen you hella times but Nicky T. your hard to find
Freak I'm never in a hurry, rollin' gettin' money
I can see it in your eyes you like to spit these lies to dummies
Man even when I'm quiet you can see a boss talker
My new turn out she got some kinnie in her walker
She's rare as a flying saucer, so it's gonna cost ya
And if I never had ya, then I certainly never lost ya
You killin' me, freak who you wanna be?
Holla at the G-O-D, ay Nicky T., Khanthology

      I'm a Gangsta
     </title>
     <lyrics>
      (*talking*)
What it do, this one for all you hoe ass niggaz
You niggaz claim to be down, we been doing this nigga
We been out here sliding niggaz, we been out here doing boys
Been out here wrecking, you niggaz ain't shit
Hoe ass niggaz, make a nigga slide your bitch ass
Under a closed do' nigga, you got us fucked up

[Z-Ro]
When it get gangsta, I don't see too many niggaz repping they set
But in front of these dog ass hoes, they rep it to death
There go Z-Ro the Crooked, better put some pep in your step
You ain't got enough insurance, to get yourself in a wreck
I put a cease on all breathing, when I squeeze my weapon
Better hope God cut for ya, cause you gon need that blessing
Somebody save him, it's gon take all of his homies to help him
And if he run, it ain't gon take but three of these to catch him
I'm dedicated to the delivery, of a Smith &amp; Wesson
While keeping it under cover, to keep authorities guessing
Who did it when it happened, real niggaz don't make a scene
Bitch niggaz publicize it, and end up with ten to fifteen
Talking about how they done crept up, on a nigga from the blind
Couldn't even acknowledge they presence, they cowards in my eye
Right before I merk me a nigga, he don't know who hit him
Before I pull the trigger, I let him see my face and then I send him

[Hook]
I'm a gangsta, pussy niggaz better stay up out my way
Frown on my face, I'm holding my AK
Handling bidness, digging ditches everyday hey
I'm a gangsta, pussy niggaz better stay up out my way
I'ma be checking niggaz, till I'm old and grey
Serious bidness, that nigga Z-Ro he don't play hey

[Z-Ro]
Ever since I was a youngster, bagging them grams up
I've seen so many times, in the back of the squad car in them handcuffs
Playing for a blue van, cause if it's red nigga that's FED
I guess it's back to drank and pretties, and eating at Jack Mack's Red
But I'd rather be free, up in the streets collecting money
From weed to drank, a long currensy just like Bun B
There go the the laws my nigga, don't let em see you hit the weed
Cause we get more than a misdemeanor, for assault rifles and cheese
Yeah I'm rapping motherfucker, but I'm still on the block
Just cause you see me on the T.V., don't mean I stopped punching the clock
That's fa sho money, I ain't seen a royalty yet but I get show money
By any means necessary, Z-Ro gotta get some mo' money
Now cheuffer's open up do's for me, it's just like Burger King
Motherfuckers love my rap and got hypnotized, the first time they heard me sing
That's why I'm able to purchase Afghanic by the pound, and a lot of drank
And to y'all jackers this ain't a glock bitch, when it pop it's out of tank

[Hook]

[Z-Ro]
These days, I roll alone it's just my heater with me
Fuck all of these females, my heavleck is my main hoe so I keep her with me
Everytime she speaks, she leave bloody white sheets
And I got a rambo knife, sharp enough to cut straight to the white meat
Make me use it on ya, take it out take a breather then reuse it on ya
It's on you I could murder your ass, or drop some murder music on ya
And fuck that Hollywood shit, I'm from the corner
Newport Short box, and a cup of coedine fuck a Corona
I'ma be grooving it, till the world stop moving y'all know what that mean
C walking  in blue and black All-Stars, with blue and black strings
A short sleeve Dickie top, with the bulletproof up underneath
Den Den you ain't no Crip nigga you's a bitch, cause you won't come to me
Talk that shit in my face, you been talking behind my back
I'm so confident that I'ma beat your ass, I ain't gotta be behind my strap
To that nigga Killa Kyleon, stay in your place
If I wanted to get you, I'd send bitches with razors to play in your face

[Hook - 2x]

      Blac Vagina Finda
     </title>
     <lyrics>
      Aiyyo what about the hoes? (Hoes?)
Yeah you know, the hoes
This is for the nappy hoes, yaknowhatI'msayin?
Yeah, word is bond
All the hoes that wanna get scrappy, we gonna do it like this for ya
Check it one time

It's just
me and Jack, the blac vagina finda (3X)
Me and Jack, it's just me and Jack

I'm the motherfucker fuckin somebody daughter
Go downstairs, shake hands with her father
Say you need her back, no dad don't bother
Excuse me mister sir, but your daughter gets the rawest

It's not everyday you get to be a genuine witness
of the nineteen ninety-two, annual, FuckFest
So take off your bra, show your breasts and move your dress
Yo what's the matter hooker, cat got your tongue?
Or do you want my tongue to get your cat and get you strung
I got the whip appeal, plus chains and bats
And always wear hats, for flippin in the puddy cats
Once it's in there's no turnin back
Move your feet, to your head, til you hear your bone crack
When bitches get dick they don't know how to act
And once you go black, you never go back
I don't discriminate and just leave it at that
I'm just one, stinky kinky, slim not slinky
Fiddle with your clitoris then pop your pussy with my pinky
Tryin to get yours, I'm tryin to get minor
It's just me and Jack, the blac vagina finda

It's just
me and Jack, the blac vagina finda (3X)
It's just me and Jack, just me and Jack

The perverted motherfuckers is at it again (3X)
Fuckin with a skin, fuckin with a skin

Nigga's in like a singer, the slick dick pussy banger
Titty strangler, rougher than a Wrangler
Guaranteed to make em bleed they need paper satisfaction
Big butt cheeks the funky breakbeat action
Leavin the hoes, smackin the hoes, leavin em on the subway
Lost without a care but can't walk cause that ass is broken
First date, veteran, better than a nympho
Sleek to the beat cause I be fuckin on tempo
Train like a trolley, lick her like a lolli
I smoke more cheeba than motherfuckin Bob Marley
Lady persuader, big panty raider
Four times a week I get stuck on the elevator
La la, live to die
Tricked on this slick and went way past her Y
Jack B. Nimble, Jack B. Quick
He got too slick, now he got a sick dick
Cause I don't really really give a fuck
Praise the Lord, cause even nuns get stuck
Never play me like a burger, I'm never double cheesy
Easy Rider or writer, stinky never fighter
Try to get yours, cause I know I'm gonna get minor
Me and Jack, the blac vagina finda

It's just
me and Jack, the blac vagina finda (3X)
It's just me and Jack, just me and Jack
Me and Jack (4X)

Ya don't stop
and ya don't quit
We're gonna be fuckin some bitches kid...
word is bond...
word, to the hoes, with the fat pussies, cunts...

     <lyrics>
      Gyeah...
All my muthafuckin niggas holla
All my muthafuckin bitches holla
All my niggas holla
All my bitches holla
If you ain't got no snaps holla
If you ain't got no ride holla
Lookin for the hook up holla
Holla, holla

(Verse 1)
You can catch me in the land of the greenest snaps
Stanks from tha strip clubs
Homies packin they straps, check it out
One-Time's kinda corrupt, the hood life's crazy
But I love the hood life, baby it's all gravy
Sunday afternoon, the midnight moon
But I'm thinkin that I gotta get to Compton soon
Got a ounce in my pocket and a cupple of grands (chin,chin)
Serve a cupple of hours and hit the burger stand
My hands stay tight on the grip you heard
We gotta duck quick, here come the bird (chipp,chipp)
Back on the block, no dope in sock
Got a house-side window where you're slightly knockin (boom,boom)
Got my tape bumpin Eazy-E and (2)PAC
Check the time on my watch bout 2 o' clock
Call the bitch at the club that I ran into
Holla back, said I come thru and shake it for you
Gyeah...

(Chorus)
All my niggas holla
All my muthafuckin...Gyeah...all my muthafuckin bitches holla
Gyeah...if you ain't got no money holla
Gyeah...if you ain't got no ride holla
Gyeah...if it's hot out here holla
Gyeah...all my niggas holla
All my bitches holla
Gyeah...

(Verse 2)
Who rap they spots and run they blocks
Who started off soft and turned to rock
If you know what I'm speakin, hook your set
You should know how to get a little extra bag
W.S. leadin a pack, we're gready like that
In hot sunny county, dippin with a hood rat
9-0, 2-2-0, that's the code
Fuck a bitch, fuck a nigga, it's the gangsta mode
The story has been told by a thousand times
Town of the thug niggas, hoes and crimes
Some niggas rap star and try to shine (bling!)
Some stay in the hood and stay on the line
That's fine with you nigga
Gyeah, I got your corner
If enemies trip you can bet they are goner
True kill niggas got 20 and better
Hood's still tight, collect cards and letters
It's still a Compton thang, whoever the pain brang
Whatever the mind frame, we can play this game
Compton for death and dollars all the same
Uh, never a shame, ya'll know the name
Holla back

(Chorus)
Niggas holla
All my muthafuckin bitches holla
If you ain't got no money holla
If you ain't got no ride holla
All my muthafuckin niggas holla
All my muthafuckin bitches holla
If you ain't got no money holla
Gyeah...Gyeah...

(Verse 3)
I know ya'll lovin this muthafuckin gang-bang-bang
Step up on the stage, strap tight in hand
Givin ya'll sumptin ya'll just can't understand
(??) my masterplan
I'm a thug til the day I can't escape the judge
Or til the One-Time sweep me under the rug
Or til the Lord takes me away from this place
So I won't see my enemies fate
Chase the dream, cause it's all about the way you kick it
Some hoes won't get down if a nigga wan' lick it
Is that the only way to go
No, 1/2 Oz. is in this
And hey, bitch put your money where your mouth is
Bounce back, cross state, takin the chance
Just to flossin, hook up with the motto and hot dance
Damn, sometimes I wonder, is this all just a bad dream
Or did the hood take me under
Ya'll know the mind frame
Ya'll know how they sheeme
How we play this game
We do it for real nigga
Packin a steel
Uh, all up on the hill

(Chorus)
Uh, all my muthafuckin niggas holla
All my muthafuckin bitches holla
If you ain't got no money holla
If you ain't got no ride holla
All my muthafuckin niggas holla
All my muthafuckin bitches holla
If you ain't got no money holla
If it's hot on the blocks holla
Gyeah...holla back ya'll
Gyeah...holla back ya'll
Gyeah...holla, holla, holla
1/2 Oz., 2000 and 1
For the millenium
Takin over this shit
For real this time
You know how the fuck we do it
Back on that ass
With the gangsta lean
C.M.W.
The underground hero
Comptons Most...Gyeah...
Holla...

      Make it Hot
     </title>
     <lyrics>
      [Intro] [Phonte talking]
And small children will gather round and tell stories to their parents.
About tales of the great Phontigalonius, Sean Boogalonius and Joseph
Wellington Scudowski over tracks applied by Khrisies. We'll make it hot.
We'll make it hot. We'll make it roaring hot!

[Verse One] [Phonte]
Ain't a motherfucker out there say I ain't spittin'
Say me and my whole team in NC ain't livin'
Say we ain't drivin'
So don't push me dawg, your style is pussy dawg
Believe me, I ain't kiddin'/kitten
Hip hop's most elusive figure
Phonte's the one
That'll shoot the trigger and have your troops delivered
In body bags
Cause your rhymes loosin' nigga
You couldn't make the crowd just to a conclusion nigga
So what's your fascination?
I'd break it down but I don't have the patience
You have to face it
Your raps lack imagination
You need to make life a part of your skills
Or else you'll be a martyr for real
And make publishin' a part of your deal
Cause lightening won't strike the same place twice
But God damn poverty will
And you can rhyme like Nas or rhyme like Pras
Won't matter cause it still won't knock like ours

[Chorus]
"Make it hot"
We make it hot for 'em
"Make it hot"
We make it hot for 'em
"Make it hot"
We don't stop for 'em
"Make it hot"
We make it hot for 'em
"Make it hot"
We make it hot for 'em
"Make it hot"
We make it hot for 'em
"Make it hot"
Take it to the top for 'em

[Verse Two] [Sean Boog]
I'm a Gillette Razor, live close to the edge
Mind's up in cloud nine, spit over your head
Bought a pillow case once for sleepin' on the industry
Told the judge I was just goin' to bed
I'll toast you for bread, flows buttery smooth
Wanna be's come at me like stuttering fools
Other words absurd, push my buttons and nerves
Hungry man, understand, a glutton with words
Sick of payin' dues, this rhyme is gonna aim at you (BOW!)
Take your rings, double burger and your pager too
O-Dog, you think I'm playin' with you?
I'm just a Menace II rhyme, doin' what I came to do
A no brainer, a simple tad really
Cause most of these rap cats just act silly
The game's ours
And I promise you this
Cause ain't a team alive that make it hotter than this

[Chorus]
"Make it hot"
We make it hot for 'em
"Make it hot"
We make it hot for 'em
"Make it hot"
We don't stop for 'em
"Make it hot"
We make it hot for 'em
"Make it hot"
We make it hot for 'em
"Make it hot"
We make it hot for 'em
"Make it hot"
Joe Scudda on the mic, let's rock for 'em

[Verse Three] [Joe Scudda]
Rappers is a dime a dozen
See me shinin' cousin
Rhymes hot like I carry lines in ovens
Baking at 350 and always had beef on my plate
Ask yourself if you really want beef with me
So
Bring your fam and your fellow crews
Fuckin' with me, you're gettin' more than your elbow bruised
Thinkin' more like I.C.U.
Cause that tough guy image you portray is something I see through
Straight to the Bitch In Yoo
And I ain't talkin' bout Common or Cube
Cause there ain't no common in dude
If I feel I got drama with you
You gonna need more patchin' up then your baby momma can do
I'm more bang for your buck buddy
Bet your bottom dollar
It's the kid from the bottom holla
We got 'em
Tell me do you follow?
And if not, I guarantee I split your head like an alvacada
What?

[Chorus] [Joe Scudda]
"Make it hot"
From college kids to thugs
We make it hot for 'em
For cats that do drugs
We make it hot for 'em
For chicks that love Joe
We make it hot for 'em
Shakin' they ass for doe
We make it hot for 'em
For cats with no heat
We make it hot for 'em
For those that sleepin the street
We make it hot for 'em
Even for the cats on the block
We make it hot for 'em
A middle finger for the cops
We make it hot for 'em

      [Redman]
Aiyyo yo fuck that!
Aiyyo I gotta find my motherfuckin mojo
Aiyyo Reggie Noble, aiyyo Reggie Noble c'mere nigga!
Aiyyo start it off while I tell you how it went down

Yo, yo
Put the drop down, get your smoke on
Get your feel on, are you feeling?
Get your girl on, get your squeeze on
Get your bus on, are you chilling?
Are you wheeling, are you feeling?
How you feeling?  And we gon' hooo-oooh-ooh
(Tell me what you doin)

C'mon, yo yo-yo yo, yo yo
I had to put the mash down, throw the cash around
Stay focused, on the case put the hash down
Jetted through the air about five miles per hour
My mojo gone I can't fly like I wanna
But this case is easy, find that motherfucker that
couldn't wait to be me, put his face on TV
From the tec blow, I asked my ex-hoes
Pass off some info for a pair of X.O.'s
Write the check low, I don't do that
I told you that shit before when I boned your back
Now I'm back to square one, and everybody hatin
So I popped the flare gun, now they all escapin
Ran into Gator, from _Jungle Fever_
He's my people and my neighbor, I said I need a favor
He said for ten dollars, and for ten Whoppers
from Burger King, I'll tell you the nigga who gotcha
Gave him what he wanted plus the extra large fry
He said blue eyes, blonde hair, a white guy
I said... what the fuck goin on?
A white guy interruptin my fuck flowin on?
So I copped some new ammo, reloaded my flare gun
Stalkin like Rambo, mixed with Commando
Gator pushed the ten-speed bike, I'm on the handle
Crashed into somethin cause he high off my man blow
I jumped up and backtracked myself
Who's the last hoe I fucked or throat I cut?
I said wait a minute, yo, that bitch Jane on the prowl again
I bet she up to no good, actin foul again
Yeah, yeah, it ain't nuttin, I get her if I want her
Matter of fact I'm gonna cause she live around the corner
I walked up scared with my hands on my flares and my armor
cause she bring drama like Jeffrey Dahmer
But I heard fuckin all the way from the bottom
I'm like, damn she yellin!  Kinda made me jealous
Knocked on the door enraged
like a broke-ass rapper, at a label that ain't toured in days
Do it clown, before I count to four now
Cause if I hit five them flares'll blow your door down
I heard the zipper zip up, and they was tryin to run
So I re-clipped the clip up, and blew it before one
FREEZE MOTHERFUCKERS, I jumped on Jane back
I WANT THE CHEESE MOTHERFUCKERS, and my name back
We tusslin, fightin, bitin skin and rustlin
Slaps in the face, chokes with the belt buckle and
her knees bucklin, I thought to myself
"Where's that motherfuckin white guy she was fuckin?" then
right out the blue {*CLANG!*} Owww! {*birds chirpin*}
Who dat?  Who dere?

     <lyrics>
      Ahh Redman..
Do you feel that the blacks in your community
are still mad at the racial situation?

[Red]	Yeah they still mad
And if you don't take that funny smirk off your face
I'ma kick your...

Over three hundred ghetto-related crimes happened
in Newark, New Jersey alone -- still the saga continues

[Redman]
Stick em up, STICK EM UP!  I got the jammie to your vest punk
Don't make a move!  Before I choose to make your guts run
all over the block, cause my stomach's in a knot
and it growls twenty-four hours a day around the tick-tock
I got roaches and vats of the rats carryin bats and gats
so I *farting noise* 'fore I snack Jack
Because I'm not down with water from the hydrant
My moms takin a bath and my brother's next arrivin
I gotta think of a plan so I can eat
I haven't had a cracker for weeks so my mouth leaks
I squat up, cause I'ma set up this kid, carryin loot out
from Burger King and what I'ma do is..
run up on him, SNATCH the bag of money, then bust the dummy!
Cause my man when I think of a plan there's no shorts take
Cause I pack jammies inside of my Nordface, coat
Had the black brother on scope
No joke's what I am cause the man's a pure pro
(Yo my man you got a light?
Yeah give me the effin money too G!)  Yo STOP STOP STOP!
Took the money then I dipped with the quickness
The plan went well so I got down to the business
Opened up the bag it was filled with paper
I thought I freaked the funk but now starts the caper
Cause I was set up, now I have to go head up with the cops
What they carryin?  Black glocks (shit's thick!)
What's the next move?  My life's on the line
Bullets in their clips and none in mine
Sirens on, once again it's on
I fell (OW!) and then the black glocks went POW!
I got snuffed and I got bust
Now the only thing I'm sniffin is dust, cause it's

("It's so rough!") 5X

Me and Erick Sermon takin a trip Uptown
In the ? run a blast and my tape pumpin ganja
Since Erick got props
I step to this hottie with more damn body than a chop shop
Flexed the jewels then she chose to talk to me
It was no doubt that baby cakes was hawkin me
So I kicked it, upped the digits, terrific
Not knowin she was scopin me cause I was MAD splifted
Later on that week honeydip freaked the funk
Playin Redman and Erick out like two chumps
Callin him weekdays, callin me weeknights
(Who had her weekends?)  Whichever man would freak right
Things got cozy one night like dynamite
We stripped to bare backs and took care of the bare facts
No hats?  Went Funkadelic
Took a splash, you know how that go fellas
Two months later (see you later alligator)
She was pissed and, I ended up seein my position
She took a blood test, she took a head check
Looked at me thinkin, "Why the hell he isn't dead yet?"
Then I asked her, "Why you lookin at me?!"
She said, "Redman because you have the HIV"
Called Erick and his set, that girl, don't mess around!
Too late, cause Erick already had his drawers down
Cause it's

("It's so rough!") 3X
[R] Cause it's so rough!

To all my brothers wear your hats wear your hats
You can either get with this or you can either catch the claps
And to my sisters, make em wear they prophyl-lastic
Cause it's drastic, havin another ghetto bastard
Think I'm vyin for a piece of butt?  Honey you must be nuts
You better settle for a wet kiss so pucker up
Cause you end up messin around catchin the heebie jeebies
Lookin like WHODUNNIT?  Witcha face up on the TV
So next time you want sex, get wreck, but protect
cause you could be like sexin to your last death
And if you still don't know the time, press rewind
cause the next thing you might hear is a flatline

      Out the Game
     </title>
     <lyrics>
      [*man talking*]
You know what I'm sayin'? He came in
He made music sound different, you know?
Makin', uh, good beats and shit
You know what I'm sayin'?
He be doin' shit motherfuckers wasn't doin'
Like the soul shit, I grew up on soul
I was eatin' Saturday and soul food at a young age
You know what I'm sayin'? Collard greens and all that shit
So I can really appreciate what Kanye West do
He done made shit I can step to
I'm a old motherfucker who like to step
This nigga make beats I can step to
So I like that shit

[Kanye West]
yo I'm really thinkin' about gettin' out the game dog
Look, there's only one girl on my agenda
(You talkin' 'bout Brenda?)
Nah I'm talkin' 'bout Linda from last September
And Linda love lace like Linda love lace LaFaces
She like lace but she love face
And I know that Linda was a hip hop head
And I know that Linda gave hip hop head
But I feel I could convert her
Cuz I ain't here to hurt her man
And she was messin' with me when I was still at Burger King
She ain't hop in my bed cuz of the whips and cream
Cuz when I had her in bed I had whipped cream
Shakespearean "Midsummer Night Dream"
I unzip things and pull out big things
They was flashin' gr-green, she was like ch-ching, got 'em
But she know a real nigga when she spot 'em
So now she thinkin' dresses and Veera Wayne
Scratchin' out her maiden and here's my name
Now I'm sittin' at the bar with all my guys
They sayin' "Cheers to you for your future years of pain"
Like "Dog, you ready to give all this shit up?"
The summer's on its way and these hoes doin' sit ups
And when they see the way the G5 lights lit up
You gonna wanna have two like John Ritter
But nah home, I bought her a brand new BM
He said "Dog, slow down like brand new bien now"
I just feel the need to purge my soul
From the word 'Go' couldn't watch another nigga get burnt slow
She said her man was good to you, always brought a new workload
Never takes it out and falls asleep in his work clothes
She needs some excitement which leads to this indictment
Believe what you like kid, accordin' to her
When we recorded with her Linda changed her name to Nicky
Sang along to "Darlin' Nicky", co-star of my quickie
That foot is so pretty
But I'm sure you recognize that bra, those titties
Those are her titties, so Laura so pretty
But not to rub it in
But them White Russians did make her lowly like the wind
So the overwrite that's in of that overnight depends
If you take heed to game and please keep ya name, word

{*Kanye West singing*}
But she's just a playa playa
That's playin' games with me

[*man singing*]
I can't see myself gettin' out the game no time soon ooh oooh
As I continue, as I continue, ooh oooh
As I continue, as I continue, ooh oooh ooohh
Can't see myself gettin' out the game no time soon ooh oooh
As I continue, as I continue, ooh oooh
As I continue, as I continue, ooh oooh ooohh

      Mr. Sandman
     </title>
     <lyrics>
      [Intro: RZA w/ singing by Blue Raspberry]
*bees buzzing*
*man screaming in torture*

This is... (Mr. Sandman bring me a good dream)
Serious, the craziest
... d-da, (Mr. Sandman bring me a good dream) day-da
Danger, dangerous... style

[Verse One: RZA]
Lyrical shots from the glock
bust bullet holes on the chops, I want the number one spot
With the science, of a giant
New York defiant, brutal like domestic violence
Silence of the Lambs, o-ccured when I slammed in
Foes grab their chairs, to be mad as Ralph Cramden
Others come with shit, as silly as Art Carney
But my Tetley triplizes, more kids than Barney
Never need for stress there's three bags of sess
a damn I rest, playing chess, yes
My thoughts be sneaky like a crook from Brooklyn
When you ain't lookin, I take the queen, with the rook then
I get vexed, layin phat trax on Ampex
Puffin skunk, gettin drunk off of Triple X
Violent time, I got more love than valentines
The violent mind, I blast with a silent nine

[Verse Two: Inspector Deck]
My hazardous thoughts to cut the mic's life support short
Brains get stained like tablecloths when I let off
Powerful, poetry pushed past the point of no return
Leavin mics with third-degree burns
Let me at 'em, I cramp your style like a spasm
Track em through the mud then I bag em
We're screaming hardcore, hip-hop drips out my balls
and I be raw, for four score plus seven more
I strike like a bowling ball, holding y'all hostage
like hail, electrifying the third rail
Peep the smash on paragraphs of ruckus
Wu-Tang (Clan ain't nuttin ta fuck wit)

[Verse Three: Method Man]
Hot time, summer in the city
My people represent, get busy
The heat-seeker, on a mission from hell's kitchen
I gets in where I fits in for head-touchin, listen
Enemy, is the industry got me flippin
I don't give a fuck tell that bitch and a nigga
I'm killin, snipin, catchin murder cases
Desert Storm-in, I be searchin for oasis
As I run a mile with a racist
Pullin, swords, hit the Billboard with a bullet
Peace to the number seven
Everybody else get the fo'-nine-three-eleven
(Mr. Sandman bring me a good dream)
I don't know what's going on
if you can take us there...

[Verse Four: Street Thug]
Yo, watch me bang the headpiece there's no survival
My flow lights up the block like a homicidal
murder, underground beef for the burger
P.L.O., criminal thoughts you never heard of
I switch, the city never sleeps, life's a bitch
I shit, runnin through bitches like Emmitt Smith
Caution, niggaz best to be careful crossin
the street, before they end up layin in a coffin
Don't sleep, niggaz tend to forget, however
Peep this -- my nigga Case lives forever

[Verse Five: Carlton Fisk]
What evil lurks in the heart of men?
It be the shadow, street-life, flowin again
I had a plot, scheme, I knew for sure
Only one kid would knock the hinges off the door
The jerk tried to jet, Sabrina at his neck
Thirteen pounds on the table plus a tec
Just when I said, "Where the fuck's the cream?"
Another jerk came out the kitchen with the M-16
He tried to cock it, blast these shots like, rockets
Crushed his collarbone, ripped his arm out the socket
My move for the table was swift, I got my hostage
(The nigga tried to stab you God!) but I dodged it
Niggaz said, "Carlton youse a ill motherfucker"
Cause I made it look like they both killed each other
And I'm out

(Mr. Sandman bring me a good dream)
(Mr. Sandman bring me a good dream)

     <lyrics>
      Gyeah...
All my muthafuckin niggas holla
All my muthafuckin bitches holla
All my niggas holla
All my bitches holla
If you ain't got no snaps holla
If you ain't got no ride holla
Lookin for the hook up holla
Holla, holla

(Verse 1)
You can catch me in the land of the greenest snaps
Stanks from tha strip clubs
Homies packin they straps, check it out
One-Time's kinda corrupt, the hood life's crazy
But I love the hood life, baby it's all gravy
Sunday afternoon, the midnight moon
But I'm thinkin that I gotta get to Compton soon
Got a ounce in my pocket and a cupple of grands (chin,chin)
Serve a cupple of hours and hit the burger stand
My hands stay tight on the grip you heard
We gotta duck quick, here come the bird (chipp,chipp)
Back on the block, no dope in sock
Got a house-side window where you're slightly knockin (boom,boom)
Got my tape bumpin Eazy-E and (2)PAC
Check the time on my watch bout 2 o' clock
Call the bitch at the club that I ran into
Holla back, said I come thru and shake it for you
Gyeah...

(Chorus)
All my niggas holla
All my muthafuckin...Gyeah...all my muthafuckin bitches holla
Gyeah...if you ain't got no money holla
Gyeah...if you ain't got no ride holla
Gyeah...if it's hot out here holla
Gyeah...all my niggas holla
All my bitches holla
Gyeah...

(Verse 2)
Who rap they spots and run they blocks
Who started off soft and turned to rock
If you know what I'm speakin, hook your set
You should know how to get a little extra bag
W.S. leadin a pack, we're gready like that
In hot sunny county, dippin with a hood rat
9-0, 2-2-0, that's the code
Fuck a bitch, fuck a nigga, it's the gangsta mode
The story has been told by a thousand times
Town of the thug niggas, hoes and crimes
Some niggas rap star and try to shine (bling!)
Some stay in the hood and stay on the line
That's fine with you nigga
Gyeah, I got your corner
If enemies trip you can bet they are goner
True kill niggas got 20 and better
Hood's still tight, collect cards and letters
It's still a Compton thang, whoever the pain brang
Whatever the mind frame, we can play this game
Compton for death and dollars all the same
Uh, never a shame, ya'll know the name
Holla back

(Chorus)
Niggas holla
All my muthafuckin bitches holla
If you ain't got no money holla
If you ain't got no ride holla
All my muthafuckin niggas holla
All my muthafuckin bitches holla
If you ain't got no money holla
Gyeah...Gyeah...

(Verse 3)
I know ya'll lovin this muthafuckin gang-bang-bang
Step up on the stage, strap tight in hand
Givin ya'll sumptin ya'll just can't understand
(??) my masterplan
I'm a thug til the day I can't escape the judge
Or til the One-Time sweep me under the rug
Or til the Lord takes me away from this place
So I won't see my enemies fate
Chase the dream, cause it's all about the way you kick it
Some hoes won't get down if a nigga wan' lick it
Is that the only way to go
No, 1/2 Oz. is in this
And hey, bitch put your money where your mouth is
Bounce back, cross state, takin the chance
Just to flossin, hook up with the motto and hot dance
Damn, sometimes I wonder, is this all just a bad dream
Or did the hood take me under
Ya'll know the mind frame
Ya'll know how they sheeme
How we play this game
We do it for real nigga
Packin a steel
Uh, all up on the hill

(Chorus)
Uh, all my muthafuckin niggas holla
All my muthafuckin bitches holla
If you ain't got no money holla
If you ain't got no ride holla
All my muthafuckin niggas holla
All my muthafuckin bitches holla
If you ain't got no money holla
If it's hot on the blocks holla
Gyeah...holla back ya'll
Gyeah...holla back ya'll
Gyeah...holla, holla, holla
1/2 Oz., 2000 and 1
For the millenium
Takin over this shit
For real this time
You know how the fuck we do it
Back on that ass
With the gangsta lean
C.M.W.
The underground hero
Comptons Most...Gyeah...
Holla...

      Drama
     </title>
     <lyrics>
      [Intro]
It was a war between us and them
The fuse was ignited throughout the world
And it couldn't be put out
Mass murderin' throughout the street blocks and neighborhoods
Somebody had to become a victim
An example, to let y'all bitch niggaz know that we wasn't for play
And the story goes -

[Daz Dillinger]
We come out the bushes, aim and shoot
Takin' niggaz out who disrespect the crew
Boom, boom, boom, the automatic tools spit out
Usin' rounds and ammos, blowin' niggaz brains out
Payback for what you did to my cousin
Swerve in a bucket, dumpin' on niggaz that started duckin'
I smoke a stick, then get back to the lynchin'
Premeditating on niggaz, I love squeezin' the trigger
Yeah, I'm weird it ain't no shame to my game
You'll get your pain close range, six feet in the grave
On the news I read "shot in the head", front page
Niggaz got shot and blasted with the 12-gauge
So again and again let the murders begin
Trends and bodies found unloaded with ten
Wrapped up with niggaz, catchin' the heat, caught in the street
Late night creeped out for somethin' to eat
Right before my eyes he died, scrap aside
Grabbed his burger and fries and disappeared in the night
Dat Nigga Daz traveled the world for all my doggs
I shall not forget about y'all until I fall..

[Daz talking]
2Pac and Biggie was fallen soldiers
Of this war that we are fightin' here in the 2000
So we are faced with danger
Scandalous niggaz and bitches
Baby mamas and trader-ass homeboys
Who plottin' to make a deal with the devil
To assassinate us and our character
And act like you are homeboy..
But no evil shall come near me or my people or my dwellings..
So though shall die by the laws of the street

[Daz Dillinger]
My murder method's untouchable, got a few niggaz to touch your soul
From the gate, I never ever did trust your crew
You just a snake in the grass on that ass
I'll pull the trigger back and blast all over that ass
Get a call from my niggaz, your person talkin' to my nigga
Enclosed plottin' or killin' a bitch ass nigga
Then shake you full of holes and no one knows
Barely alive, but eventually that nigga died
A ten year fued, this is what we breathe and what we live for
Honor and respect from the door
We hardcore, rough, rugged and dangerous
Stay smokin' our weed, sherm and angeldust
It's just us, don't ever forget it
We down with it to the bone
(And once again it's back on)
I'll get domed without seein' battle or bein' battled
I'm posted, strapped with a million volts
Electricutin' they ass and knock 'em off
That's for thinkin' we soft, we plottin' the boss
(And everything in this world has a cost)
In this game nobody wins so a nigga just lost

[Daz talking]
Catchin' them bitch ass niggaz slippin'
Rollin' through they neighborhood (right, right)
Lookin' at them sucka ass niggaz while we dump on them
BOOM!
Bullets goin' through car doors, screens, neighborhoods, and everywhere
Who shall I fear? - no one
It's time to get rid of you you bitch ass nigga, your time is comin'
Puttin' all y'all niggaz six feet in the dirt

[Daz Dillinger]
Blue rags, stolen cars with no tag we get away in
(Sprayin' it up to let you know we ain't playin')
Prayin' for an oppurtunity - soon to be your last
(When you double-cross Daz I'll put a foot in your ass)
Lessons taught by the one that played me out
(For the fame and the clout we got to take you out)
I can't be stopped by the fed or the cops
(No matter what these niggaz talkin' 'bout one way they all get shot)
Yiggy yep, made an example, beaten and trampled
(It's all for the money, that's all that I'm out for)
You'll get filled full of lead, a closed mouth'll get fed
(No matter what you said you'll get a bullet in your head, HA HA)

[Daz talking]
That's all I'm sayin'
It's overl, done for
It's time to put all y'all niggaz to rest
Don't sleep nigga
EVERYBODY DIES NIGGA! EVERYBODY DIES!
HA HAAAAAA..

      Ghetto Neighbor
     </title>
     <lyrics>
      [Verse 1 - Anybody Killa]
They call me ghetto neighbor, I don't give a fuck
Sounds bumpin' all night, steadily wakin' you up
Homies bangin' on the door because I'm slangin' the tree
24 hour weed spot,  buy two, get one free
Every week another piece of property gettin' stolen
Check it in you little buster watch your eye get swollen
Neighborhood bad ass, I think the whole block hates me
Ready to freeze psycho motherfucker actin' crazy
Ever since the young age of 13
Same house, different neighbors and they all blame me
For all them cars that got stolen, the windows that got broken
A handful of jewelry that the cops caught me holdin' (Psyche)
I've never been caught for a run that I commited
I've never seen a fat ass lick and didn't hit it
All the murders that they claimin' I ain't stressin' that shit
Cause if you got the evidence then come convict me bitch

[Hook]
Would you be my, could you be my
Won't you be my (GHETTO NEIGHBOR!)
Would you be my, could you be my
Won't you be my (WE NEIGHBORS Y'ALL!)
Would you be my, could you be my
Won't you be my (I BRINGS THE DRAMA!)
Would you be my, could you be my
Won't you be my (GHETTO NEIGHBOR!)

[Verse 2 - Monoxide]
Cars and stray dogs always fuckin' up my grass
And everytime you see me comin' you know I'm about to ask
Where your 5 at? I'm buyin' weed in 10 sacks
And fuck a bitch at Burger King just to get some free snacks
Standin' on my porch in a robe
I got some top tens with no shoe strings, I'm out cold
And the gold, hope it ain't nothin' my eye catch
I'm runnin' pockets like a campaign rep it's gettin' snatched
Dice game on the side of the crib
I'm shootin' dollar in this motherfucker, who else in?
And the cops got a problem with me, who knows why?
Prolly cause I got a couple tagged cars in my driveway
I keep it ghetto like the whitest of trash
Sellin' food stamps for cash just to get up on the fat pad
So when you see me on your block watch your back
Cause Monoxide will lay a motherfucker out flat

[Hook]
Would you be my, could you be my
Won't you be my (GHETTO NEIGHBOR!)
Would you be my, could you be my
Won't you be my (WE NEIGHBORS Y'ALL!)
Would you be my, could you be my
Won't you be my (I BRINGS THE DRAMA!)
Would you be my, could you be my
Won't you be my (GHETTO NEIGHBOR!)

[Verse 3 - Paris]
Who's that nigga slash Nasdaq sponsored ass?
Soldier devils never love, fuckin' up your country club
Bailin' through the gates, raisin' hatred in they eyes why
Try to calculate when niggaz make it when I ride by
Though you can't stand seein' any non-European
Havin' things, what a shame niggaz come, then you fleein'
But we won't, goodies too, take advantage, better school
Bigger plots, acre lots, pushin' Benz and sellin' stocks
Guess who comin' to dinner in your area?
Know you hate to share it, I love it when I'm scarin' the
Bitches in my neighborhood, I'm brutal on your whole committee
Never seemed to see how niggaz comin' from the city pretty
But we rollin', foldin' the cash holdin', bitch I'm showin' out
Keep my bidness out yo mouth
Clowin' all them racist holes, juggalos know a devil should
Roughest on my cul de sac, there go the neighborhood

[Hook]
Would you be my, could you be my
Won't you be my (GHETTO NEIGHBOR!)
Would you be my, could you be my
Won't you be my (WE NEIGHBORS Y'ALL!)
Would you be my, could you be my
Won't you be my (I BRINGS THE DRAMA!)
Would you be my, could you be my
Won't you be my (GHETTO NEIGHBOR!)

[Anybody Killa]
That's right motherfucker! Psychopathic is your (GHETTO NEIGHBOR!)
My man Paris and all that gorilla funk is your (GHETTO NEIGHBOR!)
Monox Boogie settin' it straight cause you know he my (GHETTO NEIGHBOR!)
So now that we neighbors throw up yo motherfuckin' hood! (GHETTO NEIGHBOR!)

[Hook]
Would you be my, could you be my
Won't you be my (GHETTO NEIGHBOR!)
Would you be my, could you be my
Won't you be my (WE NEIGHBORS Y'ALL!)
Would you be my, could you be my
Won't you be my (I BRINGS THE DRAMA!)
Would you be my, could you be my
Won't you be my (GHETTO NEIGHBOR!)

      My Posse's on Broadway
     </title>
     <lyrics>
      Me and Kid Sensation and that home away from home--
In the Black Benz Limo, with the cellular phone--
I'm callin' up the posse, it's time to get rippin'--
The freaks a need a sunroof, to keep you sucka's trippin'--
Everybody's lookin, if your jealous turn around--
The AMG kick keeps us closer to the ground--
we're gettin' good grip from the 50 series tires--
the Alpine's bumpin', but I need the volume higher--
cause the 808 kick drum makes the girlies get dumb--
we're rollin' Rainier, and the jealous wanna get some--
Every time we do, the sucka M.C.'s wanna battle--
I'm the man they love to hate, the J.R. Ewing of Seattle--
Picked up the posse on 23rd and Jackson--
headed for the strip, yes we're lookin' for some action--
the limo's kinda crowded, the whole car was leanin' back--
Maharaji's watchin' T.V. with two girlies on his lap--
On Martin Luther King.....the set looks kinda dead--

we need a new street so posse move ahead--
we all look kinda' SWASS the crew you can't forget--
the Mix-a-lot posse co' rippen' up the set--



My Posse's on Broadway........


UhhhRrrollin' with my posse we're gettin' kinda' bored--
there's not another posse with more points scored--
we don't walk around like criminals or flex like big gorillas--
my homeboy Kid Sensation is the teenage lady killa'--
Maharaji's on the def side dancin' like a freak--
the girlies see his booty and their knees get weak--
Larry is the white guy people think he's funny --
a real estate investa' who makes a lot of money--
Clockin' lots of dollas' we all got gold--
cruzin' in the Benz ain't got no place to go--
wheelin' 23rd we saw nuthin' but thugs--
the girlies was too skinny from smokin' all them drugs--
cause the rock man got 'em and their butts just dropped--
the freaks looked depressed 'cause the Benz won't stop--
at 23rd and Union the driver broke left--
Kevin shouted Broadway it's time to get def--
my girl blew me a kiss, she said I was the best--
she's lookin' mighty freaky in her black silk dress--
the closer that we get, the crazier that I feel--
the posse's on Broadway it's time to get ill--


My Posse's on Broadway.........


Cruzin' Broadway and my wheels spin slow--
rollin with my posse is the only way to go --
the girlies by the college was lookin for a ride--
we tried to pick them up but we had no room inside--
we put them on the trunk, we put them on the hood--
some sat up with the driver they made him feel good--
the posse's gettin' bigger, there's much too many freaks--
the muffler's draggin', my suspension's gettin' weak--
Now the posse's gettin' hungry, and Mix-a-Lot's treatin'--
we stopped at Taco Bell, for some Mexican eatin'--
but Taco Bell was closed, and the girls was on my tip--
they said, "Go back the other way, we'll stop and eat at Dick's"--
Dick's is the place where the crew hang out--
the SWASS like to play, and the rich flaunt clout--
posse to the burger stand, so big we walk in two's--
we're gettin' dirty looks, from those other sucka crews--
Kid Sensation dropped a $20, and didn't even miss it--
skeeza from anotha' crew, she picked it up and kissed it--
her boyfriend's illin', he went to slap her face--
My homeboy P.L.B. co' sprayed the boy with mace--
'Cause I never liked a punk, who beat up on his girl--
if you don't have game, then let her leave your world--
We took the girl with usssssss....with him she rode the busssss....
she gave the boy the finga', and the sucka starts to cussssss....
boy I gotta def posse, you gotta bunch of dudes--
you're broke co' cryin' bout the rock-man blues--
you beat up on your girl, and now you're all upset--
she's with the Mix-a-Lot posse, on the Broadway set--

My posse's on Broadway.............

      Big Johnson
     </title>
     <lyrics>
      [Sir Mix-A-Lot - talking]
Oh!, y'all been tellin some lies 'bout your penile region
(*laughing*)
(Female voice: Fuck me up here) (*mixed*)
That's what I heard from your girl, boy

[Break - Female voice]
We like a great big Johnson - 4X

[Verse 1]
Big momma please don't give me drama 'bout my love hummer
If you ain't pleased, then tell me what I need
If you lie, I'll play the naive guy
Tell me ten strong, you got a closer look
I know I ain't ten long, but that's okay
You call me Big Daddy anyway
And make me feel good 'bout my medium wood
She got her eyes closed, rockin me well
Tryin hard to get a nut, while she callin me Denzel
But oh well, get it Halle Berry, get it Halle Berry, get it
Two can play the games in a fantasy thing
And only five percent of men got nine and up
But eighty-five percent say they can't fit a cup, now what up?
Somebody gotta be lyin, cause I am
Claimin bout twelve on the hit-me scale
But the truth is the six to eight range, you hang
Just like the average Joe Plain, fool

[Chorus - Female voice] + (Sir Mix-A-Lot)
Bring black, bring white (uh huh)
Bring length (yeah), tonight (uh)
If not, bye bye
We like, we like a great big Johnson
(What you like?)
We like a great big Johnson
(What you like?)
We like a great big Johnson
(Ladies, what you like?)
We like a great big Johnson
(What you like?)
We like a great big Johnson

[Verse 2]
Now every entertainer claims hung but not wanted
Mister Being-less-than-a-female's-best
But have you seen a John Holmes movie?
Got the double digit wide with a pack of porno groupies!
Well my girl did, she stayed glued to dude
He swingin fourteen inches and the remote she clenches
But she's my Misses but she's his tonight
And did I tell you John Holmes was white?
Uh oh, we can't let the urban legends die
Cause I be Mandingo and he be the gringo
It ain't supposed to go like this, it was goin well
Eight was swell, but fourteen brings hell
But I can't compete with this feat, so must I eat
the ultimate burger, I clicked on a cursor
Triple W dot Ginseng dot com
Tryna drop bombs, lay it down and hit in like John

[Chorus - Female voice] + (Sir Mix-A-Lot)
Bring black, bring white (uh)
Bring length, tonight (*laughing*)
If not, bye bye
We like, we like a great big Johnson
(What they like?)
We like a great big Johnson
(Ha, what you like?)
We like a great big Johnson
(What you like?)
We like a great big Johnson
(Well say that then)
We like a great big Johnson

[Verse 3]
You can blame it on the Internet, its too much access
To big studs lookin for quick love and hugs
They used to only have magazines with a three inch punk in a centerfold
His pee-pee's cold
But oh no my ego shrunk, when they got hunks
Big J Peg, beef strapped to his leg
No strings attached to the ride
Plus they only touch with they feminine side, so why try
But I bought tools from the tools store
I heard the revolutions per minute, can make up for dippin in it
Ain't no shame in my game, you could make to claim
You say your layin the pipe, but pay attention to your wife
Lover man ..
Come home from work and John Holmes be sittin up in your thing about fourteen inches deep
And you standin in the doorway lookin at three and a half (*laughing*)

[Chorus - Female voice] + (Sir Mix-A-Lot)
Bring black, bring white (bring white?)
Bring length (huh?), tonight (say what?)
If not (yeah), bye bye
We like, we like a great big Johnson
(C'mon)
We like a great big Johnson
(C'mon)
We like a great big Johnson
(C'mon, chicks)
We like a great big Johnson
(C'mon, chicks)
We like a great big Johnson
(What you like?)
We like a great big Johnson
(What you like?)
We like a great big Johnson
(Ladies, what you like?)
We like a great big Johnson
(C'mon)
We like a great big Johnson

Female voice: Big fuckin cock (*laughing*)
Sir Mix-A-Lot: Damn girl, you meant that shit

      The Humpty Dance
     </title>
     <lyrics>
      [Verse One: Shock G as Humpty Hump]
All right! Stop whatcha doin, cause I'm about to ruin
The image and the style that ya used to
I look funny -  but yo I'm makin money, see
So yo world I hope you're ready for me
Now gather round, I'm the new fool in town
And my sound's laid down by the Underground
I drink up all the Hennessy ya got on ya shelf
so just let me introduce myself
My name is Humpty, pronounced with a Umpty
Yo ladies, oh how I like to hump thee
And all the rappers in the top ten--please allow me to bump thee
I'm steppin' tall, y'all, and just like Humpty Dumpty
you're gonna fall when the stereos pump me
I like to rhyme, I like my beats funky
I'm spunky. I like my oatmeal lumpy
I'm sick wit dis, straight gangsta mack
but sometimes I get ridiculous
I'll eat up all your crackers and your licorice
hey yo fat girl, c'mere--are ya ticklish?
Yeah, I called ya fat; look at me, I'm skinny
It never stopped me from gettin' busy
I'm a freak, I like the girls with the boom
I once got busy in a Burger King bathroom
I'm crazy, allow me to amaze thee
They say I'm ugly but it just don't faze me
I'm still gettin in the girls' pants
and I even got my own dance

[Chorus]
The Humpty Dance is your chance to do the hump
Do the Humpty Hump, come on and do the Humpty Hump
Do the Humpty Hump, just watch me do the Humpty Hump
Do ya know what I'm doin', doin' the Humpty Hump
Do the Humpty Hump, do the Humpty Hump

[Verse Two]
People say "Yo, Humpty, you're really funny lookin'"
that's all right 'cause I get things cookin'
Ya stare, ya glare, ya constantly try to compare me
but ya can't get near me
I give 'em more, see, and on the floor, B
all the girls they adore me
Oh yes, ladies, I'm really bein' sincere
'cause in a 69 my humpty nose will tickle ya rear
My nose is big, uh-uh I'm not ashamed
Big like a pickle, I'm still gettin' paid
I get laid by the ladies, ya know I'm in charge
both how I'm livin' and my nose is large
I get stoopid, I shoot an arrow like Cupid
I use a word that don't mean nothin', like looptid
I sang on Doowhutchalike, and if ya missed it
I'm the one who said just grab 'em in the biscuits
Also told ya that I like to bite
Well, yeah, I guess it's obvious, I also like to write
All ya had to do was give Humpty a chance
and now I'm gonna do my dance

[Chorus]

[Breakdown]
Oh, yeah, that's the break, y'all
Let me hear a little bit of that bass groove right here
Oh, yeah!
Now that I told ya a little bit about myself
let me tell ya a little bit about this dance
It's real easy to do--check it out

[Verse Three]
First I limp to the side like my leg was broken
Shakin' and twitchin' kinda like I was smokin'
Crazy wack funky
People say ya look like M.C. Hammer on crack, Humpty
That's all right 'cause my body's in motion
It's supposed to look like a fit or a convulsion
Anyone can play this game
This is my dance, y'all, Humpty Hump's my name
No two people will do it the same
Ya got it down when ya appear to be in pain
Humpin', funkin', jumpin
Jig around, shakin' ya rump
and when a doo-doo chump punk points a finger like a stump
Tell him step off, I'm doin' the Hump

[Chorus]

Black people, do the Humpty Hump, do the Humpty Hump
White people, do the Humpty Hump, do the Humpty Hump
Puerto Ricans, do the Humpty Hump, just keep on doin' the hump
Samoans, do the Humpty Hump, do the Humpty Hump

Let's get stoopid!

[Chorus]

Oh, yeah, come on and break it down

[Outro]
Once again, the Underground is in the house
I'd like to send a shout out to the whole world
Keep on doin' the Humpty Dance
And to the ladies...
Peace, and Humptiness forever

      The Odd Couple
     </title>
     <lyrics>
      (Humpty Hump)
Good googily goo
Look what the cat dragged in
The mack's back in, we snap-crack in
We got the jokes for you
Uh, look who the Hump bumped into
The old one-two, rhyme sayer, the paper maker
Biz lay the vapours

(Biz Markie)
I'm the vapour sprayer for the himilayas
The M-iza A-ya R-iza K-aya
I'm the mayor
Leavin' emcees in a ditch

(Humpty Hump)
So get ready, we 'bout to start a fight in this bitch

(Biz Markie)
Humpty dumpty had a fight with his moms
He broke both her legs and both of her arms
Tidy Bowl Man tried to throw a fit
I told his punk ass he was full of Shhhh...

(Humpty Hump)
Shut your mouth biz
See you're allways trying to take it further
I heard you bit a burger, with a funky worm in it
well you had to play stupid 'cause you didn't clear the sample
and lordy lord, got you pushing hot dogs

(Biz Markie)
Tupac was the only one that was living large
And Humpty your nose is a two-car garage
I know you got sooooul
I heard you don't eat pussy you be eatin' booty hole

(Humpty Hump)
No my nose be in the booty, my tounge be in her vertical smile
I heard your sister had sex with Colin Powell

(Biz Markie)
Your moms don't brush her teeth
I heard her breath was strong

(Humpty Hump)
Yo you wrong

(Both)
Why can't we just get along?

Why can't we be friends, why can't we be friends
Why can't we just get along?
Why can't we be friends, why can't we be friends
The odd couple

(Biz Markie)
The city so nice, they had to name it twice
New York, New York, the land of lights
We got the fashion, the widget, the project ditches
The Apollo, the Broadway, The Garden, the Pictures

(Humpty Hump)
So? We got the palm trees, Gs being Hollywood swingin' large
Cars around the block with the stars on the sidewalk
Every stop lights a show case, not lexuses
Brothers in Hummers following other friends in Benzesus

(Biz Markie)
Ya, that's cool, Y'all doin' your thing
But look what they did to that man Rodney King
They beat him, and stomped him, like a bunch of grapes
when I seen him he looked like the Planet of the Apes

(Humpty Hump)
Ya you right, police don't act tight but in the riots yo
California niggas wasn't scared to go
at poh poh

(Biz Markie)
So yo, I'll take you down like Mavis
Every Burrough is Thurough, don't forget Larry Davis

(Both, trading lines, Humpty is first)
We got Dre and Quincy Jones, homes

Primo and Puff, Hump

Easy E and Tupac nigga

Scott La Rock and Biggie nigga

Compton

Bronx

Oakland

Brooklyn Bridge

Golden Gate, plus Huey Newton

Malcom X

You got rats

Earth quakes

Well at least you'll never catch me wearing wigs in my videos

Oh, you don't have to go there, with your big, plastic nose

What about your big ass head?

What about your buck ass teeth?

Your moms so black, I looked at her and thought that i was asleep

Your nasty ass moms gave me ear infection over the phone

Come on man, why we can't get along?

Why can't we be friends, why can't we be friends
Why can't we just get along?
Why can't we be friends, why can't we be friends
The odd couple
(twice)

      The L.A. Song
     </title>
     <lyrics>
      * send corrections to the typist

[Intro]
Yo, alot of people be steppin to us like
Y'all from San Francisco right?
Nah G we show alot of love
But in the state of California from Humboldt to Oceanside ya dig
But L.A. is where it all happens for the Dub and Thes One
All you MC's say L.A. when you on stage
And when you do spit that hot verse
We gonna make it happen man

[Verse One: Double K]
Who wanna test?
We lickin' off shots in the west
We make believers out the best
Lay the weak to rest
In southern California ain't no place like this
Have to stuff y'all too and we created this shit
So don't be saggin young buck in the presence of this
Don't even come from the city and your runnin your lips
I'm 'bout to make a call get the news van out
Explain to trisha (?to your da'?) on how your crew ran out
We comin live from the trey two three area code
Mad clouds of smoke and ain't no room for snow
Sucka niggaz with sucka beats
Stay in the back seat and buckle up for the ride
I'm chillen with bad guys
And got time on my side
Cause this is my city this is where I live
And if ya bring bad vibes I got something to give
Hangin out under the sun is an everyday thang
And gettin crazy in the labs the only way I bang
Don't step to me with that mean face
Buddy I'm all smiles and I'm countin the miles
Down Crescent Heights boulevard
Home of the stars
Get ya pulled out ya car for frontin' too hard
Just listen, you ain't down with the streets my brotha?
I can forsee in your future ther'es some runnin for cover
Alot of y'all talk a good game
But ain't playin
I learned about the hood and now feel thats where your stayin
Fools be givin you the mad dog after the show
Cause we ain't feelin them flows
Or your designer clothes
Its phony people in L.A. I counted its alot
And if the hanus catch your a bully there claimin your block
Just get it right its Crescent Heights all day all night
The community where I was raised
Livin my days
Wishin I could be the mayor i'd deport you fools
And send you back to squareland cause over here we brew
Authentic people in the town
Throw up your dub take a drag
It's Double K signin off from the home of the bodybags

[Verse Two: Thes One]
Yo about five years after they kill
Creep up the hipe
Wrestlee moovahs the sleepers
Drugdealers rock beepers
T tops, jerry curls, jelly flip flops for girls
C.B.'s on the strip and a commercial for world
All wheels I whistle to my crew up on the block
The color soundtrack rock the fat burger do box
My L.A. U.S.C memories are every sticks who filed down clowns
Claimin the same tricks on this turf
My roots go deep like turbo Nerf
And the cops still sweat us
I roll on all blocks like I'm sellin paletas
And rock the bells
Home of the drive-by where they pop the shells
I eat at (?chuttles en la baka?) not Taco Bell
And if your not from the city then you should probably bail
Cause alot of cats are implants
Claimin our labels something to say and something to prove and
At the shows with the flows and they think the crowds groovin
Its like the 405 at 5:30 nobodys movin
I'm tired of non-recognition losin the mission to proven to cats
That my soundtracks and L.A. hat
When newjacks strap New York rap on the block
With a palm tree it makes me sick
All you underground producers get off Premier's dick and just (chill)
I'm headed back to Pe-dro to sit up on the hill
Next to the Korean bell eatin bizzy bee
Watchin waves swell high visibility catalina and sail boats
Hollywood hip hop soaps and sit-com dreams
I make morphine for beat fiends
Support L.A. teens stay trippin with Cal Green
O.G. Jerry Duffey when I'm on your screen
I'm friends with neighborhood crack heads
And I know (?Ben?)
L.A. is the place where I solve my problems
In it i'll never fear
I'll always stay here
Cause when I'm in L.A. my family's there

     <lyrics>
      [Threat]
I told you every nigga on my block, won't stop
One time rather send RoboCop
Cause comin down my block is like comin out the pockets
Damn it's hard to see behind a stocking (mask)
Niggaz get sniped in broad daylight
So imagine what the fuck go on at night well let me tell you
The holy's, the two-lows and, who knows
The nigga had some sales but now they gone, where they at?
In the back of my El Camino, my homie Deano
sold 'em to me half price cause he knew me
Then I went straight to the paint and a throw cost a bank
So who the fuck can I date?
Eeney-meenie-meenie-miney-moe, whatchu' got?
Very next stop - hydraulic shop
I used to have a 211 case but they dropped it
So turn around punk so I can check yo' back pockets

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
{*scratch*} "Tie 'em up" - give it up
"Somebody gots ta.." - give it up

[Threat]
Roll through the hood and say whassup to the homies
Put two hundred on the forties
And hit the switch and let the ass on the six just drag
Showin off my rim no gold knockoff ("oh no!")
Clownin this like side to side, front to back
So you can get with this or get with that
It's ninety-two but if you do bring a crew cause the L.A. Zoo
is straight puttin niggaz on Q..
They just mad cause they can't get with the
niggaz who be talkin that ol' fly pimp shit
Cause they don't wanna slang, they'd rather smoke
Comin up short, accidentally coppin soap (damn!)
Only the strongest survive the longest
All my G homies put me up on it
So watch cause if you watch it's too big
Hers and his you know what time it is, come out the pockets

[Chorus]

[Threat]
Gank the rich and give to the poor
And that's for makin momma do the floors
It ain't no way in a fuck y'all can make a butler
out a Westside, hard time hustler (like me)
I'd rather see a grave, than be a slave
On front page on the stage with a twenty gauge
Cause ropes and whips and belts don't help
So you can bail that motherfuckin hay yo'self
For five-twenty-five they must be high
Smokin up three and fo' chickens at once
Servin them thangs like Burger King
So let me show you love on a fat dub
But I didn't know he was a NARC with the police department
Then again I wouldn't know I never seen the seargeant
sucker, now I'm stuck up like a (?)
And tell my bitch to come get me up out this motherfucker
Jammed, cause, Uncle Sam
is givin ten years for every damn gram ("Bam!")
You wanna throw away me and throw away the key
And stick me in the dungeon with the criminals, him and those
deputies, kickin those refugees
I made bail punk so you can have my bunk

"Tie 'em up" (give it up) "and then feed the bitch pork!" -&gt; Ice Cube

(That's how them motherfuckers did me.
Gave me handcuffs and a ham sandwich.)

Strike three, hehe
It's-just-thug-men-tal-i-ty, nigga..
Ha, YEAHHH, ha, yeah-YEAHHH, uh-uhh, uhh..

Ras Kass register Richter with nine point eight tectonic plate quakes
Firm rubber no breaks, California plates Golden State
Catch me sittin on the roof, bumpin Snoop
"Gin and Juice" reminiscin bout the rides and gang truce
Seventy degrees in the winter - tropical weather
and vendettas cause L.A. niggaz be all about they cheddar
Hoochie bitches and B.G.'s too big for they britches
Curb servin, they double up to get richer
Fuck around them lil' niggaz comin to get'cha and get wit'cha
Dump until six hit'cha, don't let the sunshine and palm trees
fool you get the picture, niggaz be in Hollywood thinkin it's all good
But everything South of Wilshire, is all hood
Niggaz committin murder
Later that night at Tommy's eatin a chili-cheese burger
Menace II Society, seen that
Kobe and Shaq - Lakers bout to bring the championship ring back
From Ladera Heights to Venice Beach
Dime pieces with BMW leases and Cartier timepieces
I was born to raise West coast til my casket drop
Throw up a dub, spittin at the camera like 'Pac, ptooey

Chorus: Ras Kass (repeat 2X)

Would y'all get down for me, I'ma represent my town
so y'all represent y'all town for me
If a G's gettin made, put it down with me
Homey that's a West Coast Mentality

[Ras Kass]
Three-hundred and ten angels, flossin nine-hundred and nine fdangles(?)
Two-hundred and thirteen sets to gangbang too
Three-hundred and twenty-three hungry homies want steak
Never been greedy, if I ate/eight, one-eight (donate)
So if I gotta choose a coast, I got to choose the West
Born and raised out there, so don't - go there
Oh yeah, I'm the illest nigga, clownin y'all fools
with everything y'all say like Luther Luffeigh
I swoop through L.A. hoe, bendin y'all bitches like clay dough
Fuck what you say doe, these streets are fatal pendejo
So everywhere I go I take West coast with me
Home of the driveby, Thug Life and dickies
What you know about silk shirts (huh?)
Cross corded snakeskin belts, flippin off the front porch
Lesson number one - niggaz don't give a fuck
and lesson number two remember lesson number one

Chorus

[Ras Kass]
See in L.A., niggaz don't walk, niggaz drive whips with beats
Weak niggaz trick, most niggaz say bitches ain't shit
but hoes gotta eat too, they all be at Club Lingerie
with a gay down to meet you
But fuck a three-piece suit
Y'all niggaz dressin like y'all goin to church
Either me and my homies get in lookin like this or we skert
(errrrrrrrrr) and if they bullshittin, we just parkin-lot pimpin'
Sunday night, Jamaican gold, hip-hop and cheeba
Tuesday lesbian divas be up in Peanuts (what)
I be fuckin baby girl and her stud
Plus she said my dick was big, my shit be up in the gut
Waittress bitch tryin to front like we broke, "Whattup loc?"
Give me a Henn' and O.J. without slashin Nicole's throat
C-arson nigga, I'm just the illest emcee
All California Love, rest in peace Bigga B.

      Dreamzzzzz
     </title>
     <lyrics>
      [Chorus: 4X]
+Dreamzzzzz+ of fuckin' a female news anchor
I'm just playin', but I'm sayin'

[Canibus]
Yea, this isn't excellence in journalism
I prefer to call it conservative words of wisdom
Mixed with perverted visions
I can't help it; I was bitten by the Celtic Woman
Who spoke elvish, who told me I was selfish
Nah honey be friendly you're my Ms. Money Penny
I love you because when they hate me; you defend me
+Dreamzzzzz+ of fuckin' a female news anchor
Welcome to my world of fantasies and fandom
0330 central news network
I filled out visitor's paperwork 'til my head hurt
Key words bees and birds can't help but to be perverse
About anything over 30 in a skirts
I get up stairs to search who's doin' their leg work
I seen her walk in to the coffee room, I go there first
She was beautiful in burgundy, Zane Verjee
I said "Allah have mercy", she heard me and turned to me
She showed me her breast, I was impressed
She suggested I lock the door so we could both get undressed
Quick start, quick finish, I gently kissed her
The phone rang; it was Wolf Blitzer sayin' "He missed her"
I was not surprised, I ain't want the bitch to lose her job
OH MY GOD! Is that Sumi Das?
Still hard from Zane givin' me brain, but I can't complain
I'll take wrinkles over stains anyday, anyway where did the Sumi go?
She reminds me of this ho I used to bang on a Pakistani Sushi boat
Her trail went cold; I stole me an access card
Picked up the trail in the parking garage
I pretended I was an intern
I said "Ma'am you left this upstairs; a huge diamond earrings"
She just stares, standin' there in a dress with a delicate smell of vinaigrette
She placed the palm firmly on my chest
"Are you St. Germaine?" she said, I said "Yes"
And I seek to have sex with the Dragon Princess
She circled her hips slow, dancin' to Calypso
She brought her lips close, my dick grows, she sniff Coke
I couldn't believe the nerve of this
Circus Witch with burger itch
You tried to curse me with a kiss
Nosferatu practitioner, I don't even think about kissin' her
She will remain my prisoner

[Chorus: 4X]

[Canibus]
Yea, check the defense mechanism of this next woman
She's the real Lara Croft; I couldn't wait to have sex with her
Arwa Damon so calm under pressure
But our hormones start raging as soon as I undress her
Started to speak in discrete descriptive speech
I tasted her nipples and told her "Her tits taste like a peach"
She had congressional oversight, over the mic
A young Black man obsessed with her egg shell white
Her body was tight, "Ok" I said but not tonight
Your life is your job; my job is my life
Filled with gold spindles, a positive polarity signals
But when I talk to strippers I'm simple
Like screwin' Julie with the booty dimples
She act moody 'cause she's mental
Try to imagine what she's been through
Julie Banderas got what I call a rare ass
That's the type of ass that could tear pants
I let her dance on my Fer-de-lance, Caliente Sangre
And life goes on like John Mellencamp

[Chorus: 4X]

[Canibus]
Yea, yo, I don't wake up 'til 12:00
Soledad O'Brian don't wake up 'til she feels cock
I love these women so much, I can't stop
Sir Lancelot givin' Guinevere a shamrock
Accompanied by a rose, she smelled it with her nose and froze
It was the perfect time to take off her clothes
The tale of the Princess and the P and MC
Mr. C; really? A magnificent read
In a dream I had about my favourite anchor of them all
In my dream I wrote a name across The White House wall
Suzanne Malveaux - oh I have love you so
So much so I let the whole world know
Her pastry is so tasty; I don't care if her husband hates me
I'm still in my dream, DO NOT WAKE ME!
In the dream she and I share pound cake and tea
In between her shifts on the silver screen
She lays her head on my arm during The White House conference, at dawn
Imagine that when you listen to my song

[Chorus: 4X]

     <lyrics>
      * send corrections to the typist

Shitted on, ran from it (I did it all)

I sold dope, watch fiends crave for rock
Watch 'em watching me put the stash in my sock (Hey! Yo! Yo!)
Walkie-talk to niggas from the corner when the Feds 'bout to enter
Pumped up blocks some of the winter
Kerosene heaters by feet, takin tops off just so a nigga can eat lunchmeat
Four days no Z's, from the first to the third
End of the month to excited to get sleep, I bagged up 2's
Aggravated by picky motherfuckers who don't know which rock to choose (Picky man)
Took outta town trips, two seconds in a son of a bitch
NARCs run in talking shit (who dis?)
I know about dope, lost my man Lou to the coke
Pumping over there off of DeSoto
Any nigga who don't know about this
I hit ya with the Iron Mike quote "That's Ludicrous"
Shittin in the tub, pissing in the tub, Hepititis B inflicted in a thug
I know about that shit right there
Hey yo, I know about that shit right there

Hey yo, Dope, Jobs, Homeless, I did it all
Y'all niggas can't tell me shit
Dope, Jobs, Homeless, did it all
Who the fuck goin' to tell me shit?
Dope, Jobs, Homeless...

I don't had jobs black
Boss man yelling at the top of his lungs about a fuckin Fat Burger!
We damn near fired, restaurant manager who can't manage shit
Stressed out retired, I'm talking about blacks
You work all week for Boo, and one day your man Boo just collapse
Bricks, houses, cars
A bitch who drops her drawls for a nigger who can really floss
Five twenty five can make your mouth leak and on top of that shit
You get a check every week
You work a week in the hole, with thirty motherfuckers on pay roll
You work when they want you to
Equal opportunity? Nigga right, suburban community check stubs always hella tight
My shit looking like this
I got a bitch a baby and I need a place to piss
Pissed off at check time cuz I was skipped
That's when obie trice start cockin' back his shit (fuck this)


Dope, Jobs, Homeless, did it all
Y'all niggas can't  tell me shit
Dope, Jobs, Homeless, did it all
Who the fuck gonna tell me shit

I done been homeless, no place to sleep
Moms don't wanna hear it no place to eat
Pass out on my mans couch just for a week
Till he get fed up and kick a nigga to the street (Get the fuck outta here, dogg!)
Black out from cold, freezin' my toes
Snow fuckin over my boots, my Tims froze
Face turnin blue, cars ridin by with the little children
on the inside pointin at you (mommy look at that man)
Fucked over folks, and they don't wanna see ya
Baby momma gotta new nigga with a Visa
Sleepin in cars, abandoned shit
While the rats eat the wires you be prayin and shit (Please, Lord, please!)
Close to pneumonia
Wishin for heat, like damn if only I came up in California
Plottin on a (?), like stickin your mans
Damn, you know he got at least a grand in his pants
Face lookin old, despite the fact your only 20 years old
Stuck in the cold
Snot drippin profusely
Taking the alley route so my ex-cutie wouldn't notice me

Dope, Jobs, Homeless, did it all
Who the fuck goin' to tell me shit
Dope, Jobs, Homeless, I did it all
Y'all niggas can't tell me shit
Hey yo, Dope, Jobs, Homeless, I did it all
Who the fuck gonna tell me shit?
Dope, Jobs, Homeless, did it all
Motherfucker, I don't did it all

Yeah! Shit is real out there, yeah

Nap Entertainment, 2000

      Ghetto Bounce
     </title>
     <lyrics>
      [Moochie Mack talking]
A this straight up ghetto shit, you know talkin' 'bout
No purpose at all, I'm talkin' 'bout ghetto shit
I'm tallkin' 'bout when niggas wrappin' hot-dogs in a piece of bread
And fuck it up, you know talkin' 'bout?
I'm talkin' 'bout the white folks
that just be walkin' around barefooted, dirty
I'm talkin' 'bout trailer parks,
yeah yeah that's the ghetto, that's the white ghetto
Gold teeth, heard full of hair, still tryna get some weave
I'm talkin' 'bout ghetto shit, you know talkin' 'bout?
Bounce to this shit

[Moochie Mack]
Everybody want me to get a job, man I rather kill and rob
Get on the street and sale some dope, make that motherfuckin' dope Big Choke
Yes I'm from Atlanta man, peal you like a banana man
Come on let me tell you my master plan, I wanna be talkin' 'bout channels man
Sale moe dope then the government, make back all that money I spent
Fuck a house I'll build a tent, that way I ain't gotta pay no rent
Nigga I'mma try this rap hit, nigga ya'll betta clap shit
'Cause I'm tryin' hard shit, ya'll make a nigga fuck that shit
Put that reefa in a blunt, put that blunt up off a twist
Put that twist up off some fire, put that fire off in ya mouth
Nigga let's ride, get real high, smoked out 'till we satisfied
Go get them hoes, make them hoes say itchy itchy ey ey
Moochie Mack on the go, high as hell, oh no
Why the fuck everything movin' so slow?
I'm still in control, but all of the patrol, wit moe hoes
Like poe-poe lookin' for niggas wit no blow
But noooo, they'll never catch me
'Cause I be the m double o to the c-h-i-e
From the g-h-e-t-t-o, lady grab a 'bro, take 'em to the floe
And bounce it real low, then back up
give me a second while I roll the sac' up
Prepare for the second verse, I just might smoke the track up
Whether in house shoes, gators, or six inch steletos
Bounce if you from the ghetto, from the ghetto, bounce

(Chorus 2x)
If you ghetto and you know it, bounce bounce (bounce bounce)
If you ghetto and you know it, bounce bounce (bounce bounce)
If you ghetto and you know it, and you ain't scared to show it
If you ghetto and you know it, bounce bounce (bounce bounce)

[Moochie Mack]
Man, niggas be wantin' to know why, I get so high
I tell them the only reason you can tell 'cause them red eyes
I be like damn man, let me do my damn thang
I don't be fuckin' wit' chu', while you at that Burger Kang
Nigga back up, ain't none of yo' gotdamn kids
Nigga back up, ain't none of yo' gotdamn friends
You finna' get slaped up, if you say something again
I snatch the track up, me, herb and slim all in
Now that's dead serious, I know you wanna be us
But yo' ma' won't let you cuss
And yo grandmama 'nem go fuss, but it's OK
'Cause you can't rap any way
If you could rap you probably wouldn't have shit to say
So nigga bounce

(Chorus 2x)

[Moochie Mack]
I be the pussy wetter, big money bodicussy getter
The bitch you came wit', bet five I leave wit' her
If yo' rap's constipated, I be the big shitter
Bring ya' mama in the room, spread her legs and let me hit her
Dick bigger than motherfucka in porno pictures
Big chocolate, big nuts, bitches call me snicka
Henny sipper, naw I be the blunt spliter
My nigga buy quater pound, yo' niggas buyin nickels
Go getta off in ya' ear 'cause I'mma game spitter
I ain't sayin' shit, as long as them langs wit' her
Take her to the room, then I hot brrrr brrrr stick her
Bigger nigga then most of ya'll two dolla flippers
Down-south hall of fama, Moochie Mack's my nama
I hit yo' bitch and make her do the Mackarana
If you ain't talkin' 'bout money nigga shut the fuck up
And if you hear this jam from the ghetto get the fuck up and bounce

(Chorus 2x)

      Voice Talking: But anyway I..I..I like to value my

deeply involved I just, I just have to feel like
oral sex would complete our relationship

Yo-Da-Lin In The Valley

Unusual kinda casual yes with me girls are obsessed
To get undressed
Get fresh and have me
Yodle In The Valley
And I'd do it at the drop of a dime (dime)
Sometimes goin from behind (from behind)
Slowly strokin, no jokin
My tongue just keeps on pokin
And the best type of oochie coochie
Is the type that tastes like sushi
Eat it
Watch a girl get fricky
And then wash it down with a shot of whiskey

Yo-Da-Lin In The Valley
Yeah Kid Rock Kid Rock
Yo, Yo, Yo, Yo Da Lin In The Valley
Yeah Kid Rock Kid Rock
Yo Da Laheoooo

Yo here's a story
(Check it out)
I remember when I spent the night at Sally's house
Woke up with Cotton Mouth
Couldn't speak
My tongue was weak
From Yo-Da-Lin In The Valley
Oh I love them mountain thighs
And a pizza pie before my eyes
But before I taste them juices
I make sure this Sally douches
But she's not the only one
I like to Yodle On
It sounds wicky wacky ticky tacky
But yo you know that I'm most happy

Yo-Da-Lin In The Valley
Yo, Yo, Yo, Yo Da Lin The Valley
A delicious break from potatoes

Yo Da Laheoooooo
Yo, Yo, Yo, Yo, Yo, Yo, Yodalin in the valley

Girls think I'm a freak cause I don't speak
Whisper In their ear and make it clear
I love em'
Sorry dear don't hate
Cause I'm not gonna say I love you when your sitting upon my face
Oh yes It's warm and wet
In the valley you bet (bet)
And get this, one girl I yodled on
Had a bush thicker than the amazon
Forest
I felt like a tourist
A backpacker
Oh shit wheres my weedwacker
Came out with hair on my toungue
But still I got the job done

Yo-Da-Lin In The Valley

Yo, Yo, Yo-Da-Lin In The Valley

Yeah Kid Rock Kid Rock

      Chorus
Let's go get em' let's go get em'
Let's go get em' let's go get em' dawg x2

[Kane &amp; Abel]
My click is killers
In the line of fire in a pack of stuff affiliated mob figures
Down with mortal combat camouflage soldier rags 44 mag
And you wants to die when we ship bags and hold tags
We rolling up and we holding up
Boot up or shoot up and get that jaw swollen up
Killer please give me some gangsta shit know the click cock it back
Kane &amp; Abel bout that combat bitch

[Soulja Slim]
Go get em' with split em' don't bullshit em'
Hit em' with a round now the tank split em' split em'
Don't let a nigga catch you slipping we camouflage
Killer connection committed armed surprise
Duck and die for the buster but I'm straight as a crease
Heat seek don't sleep when my trigger finger tweak
Bloody bodies in the streets somebody call brand nino
Cause seeing dead gifts make my day card

[Mac]
Now what y'all know about Mac cause I'm murder murder
Flip em' like Burger King workers be flipping burgers
And I'm finger fucking till them niggas bust back
With the hollows it's been more dead then the others around follow
Now bite the bullet and swallow
I was tattooed with a broken wine bottle
Never die that's been my motto since 14 lottos
Got to get em' before they get em' cause if they hit me I'm gone
Skinny niggas don't love long with a bullet in their bones

Chorus x2

[Big Ed]
Now when I say Big Ed you say assassin Big Ed assassin
What's up what's happening
I keep my trigger finger blasted tank ready to roll
Picking up soldiers from rich now bringing them to the N.O.
Nigga I'm bout mine I got nines wiser up
Swolled up tagged up tagged up not giving a fuck
Nigga I'm wit' it to bring the ruckus
Busting if you touch this a No Limit soldier still got more dick than
busters

[Fiend]
It's a disaster blast em' specialization retaliation
Fuck who I'm facing boy bring the caroltation
Consultation begins to happen when I'm rapping
We gon' see who really asking when my hammer gets to smacking
Attacking and lacking my every vocal creates a checking
I should have been got that high control before lyrical seconds
I'm the insider probably the baddest
Greens cornbread and cabbage
Mr. watch me hit em' lit em' about to go get em'

[Mia X]
Here comes the biggest mamma  baby what you wanna do
Tank full of riders military minded soldiers
Hitting you with that hater ain't gon' get up now mo' for sho'
Combat where they at alright alright lets go
Now you gon' start it when your click is weak
When it's on we gon' give that ass a chance to retreat
Verbal heart but we could take it to the streets
Get em' up pull the thangs shoot em' up see yo people root em' up
What what run on up and as a matter of fact
Watch me put that ass down like a flag
Call the colonel yeah cause we some warriors
Dropping and stopping hollering lets go get em' nigga fuck we got em'

[Mystikal]
When it's gon' go down it's gon' go down
What's gon' happen gon' happen
Cause y'all know these T.R.U. niggas capping and slapping
We packing and macking
Y'all niggas be slacking and lacking
We smacking and stacking
Uh oh we blasted and laughing
Where my fucking money at is what we be asking
Busting on backstabers is how we be acting
If I catch you ass down is one way to put it
When we get it's gon' be banned from TV footage

      Jailhouse Rap
     </title>
     <lyrics>
      In Jail
In jail
Unh-unh...
Unh-unh...

In jail, in jail, without no bail
In jail, we're in jail because we failed
In jail, in jail, without no bail
In jail, we're in jail because we failed

Now there was just one day
That I will never forget
I got jailed for something that
I'll always regret

It was twelve o'clock, midnight
And I wanted a snack
So I headed downstairs
Thought the fridge was packed
But when I opened the door
What did I see?
The back of the fridge staring right at me
I thought to myself
I could almost die
Then an immage appeared
A pizza pie

So I put on Adidas
Headed out the door
As I pictured myself
Eating more and more
But the store was closed
I busted into a rage
So I went to the crib
And got my twelve-gauge
Ran back to the shop
Busted won the door
And all I saw
Was pizza galore

So I stuffed my face
I couldn't even walk
I couldn't laugh, smile
Shake, giggle, wiggle, or talk
So I fell asleep with my face in my plate
And the next thing you know
I was headed upstate

In jail, in jail, without no bail
In jail, we're in jail because we failed
In jail, in jail, without no bail
In jail, we're in jail because we failed

Well, Kool Rock is my name
Last part is "ski"
And I have the worst
Case of my M.C.
But listen to the story
'Cause it's kind of strange
When I had this sort of hunger pain
Walking down the strreet
With the bass of my box
With my stomach growling
Like a hungry fox
When I saw this scene
Or was it a dream?
A big restaurant sign
Called Burger King
So I went inside
Started stuffing my face
Didn't even think
About the things I ate
But when the bill came up
Boy, was i shocked
I said, "I don't pay for nothing
I'm the King of the Slops!"

In jail, in jail, without no bail
In jail, we're in jail because we failed
In jail, in jail, without no bail
In jail, we're in jail because we failed

But when our time is through
We'll rock you and you
We turn parties out
Make you scream and shout
We're not demanding
Or very outstanding
We got something unique
And in the middle he's standing
On the microphone
He rocks and shocks
Homeboys and girls
It's the Human Beat Box

Break

Now I'm sitting here alone
Looking at the wall
Just thinking about
How I took the fall
I thought I was cool
I thought I was slick
And now Im writing
Letters of being homesick
I lost my freedom
When I heard the door slammer
And now I'm breaking rocks
With a big, heavy hammer
I used to drive the streets
With my big car
And now I look and all
I see are bars
I jail
Everyone's the same
You only survive
If you play the game
You don't have guns
And now you remember
You're your momma's son
You made her cry
And stay up all night
Coming home high
Just leaving a fight
You always made her feel
That you were better
But now you're a little boy
Just waiting for a letter

      Risky Business
     </title>
     <lyrics>
      [MURS]
See, had the place to myself, my parents went outta town
So I had the music up and was runnin' around
Singing to the beat of my favorite underground
Song at the time, let's just say it was MURS
I was rappin' in the mirror, I was knowin' every verse
I was doin' my thang until the doorbell rang
It was my homeboy Shock, a mellow type of fellow
That I knew from up the block, he walked in and said:

[Shock G]
Yo, what's the deal MURS? First things first, you couldn'ta hit me
At a better time, them four cars behind me, they with me
All women, all dimes, the redhead she's mine
She wanna hump me, yo that's my brother Humpty

[Humpty Hump]
What's up yo? Pardon me, but I gots to go, where the bathroom at?
Y'all got liquor? Come on, Trina! Yo this house is fat
'Ey cat, you wanna hit this? Oops I shouldn'ta did that
I'll clean it up before your folks come home, yo where they at?

[MURS]
Man I don't believe you brought this nigga man I heard about his ass
The only fool dumb enough to flunk his P.E. Class
It's not that he's dumb, he's just wild and he's ignorant
Known for gettin' mad drunk and gettin' all belligerent
Man I'm sick of this I shouldn'ta told nobody
I mean three's company, but four cars makes a party
Mental note: lock the garage, hide the keys to dad's Rolls
'Cause it's outta control, this bitch is taking off her clothes

[Shock G]
Is your dad's Rolls blue? 'Cause I got bad news
Humpty took a cruise, and barbeque pit went in the pool
Turned the water grey, I would stay and help you clean up
But the neighbors say police are comin', I'm bout to G up

[Humpty Hump]
Beep, beep, beep! Yo, I'm back MURS, where should I park it?
I brought the whole strip club with me, we bout to spark it
My girl urled in your backseat, but yo it's cool
We got weed and some shrooms, is it cool to use your dad's room?

[Chorus 2X]

It's risky business, man what is this?
I'm caught up in a twist, and I'm tryin' to fix shit
It's risky business, man what is this?
I'm caught up in a twist, now I'm tryin' to fix it

[MURS]
What you mean my dad's room? Nigga is you crazy?
And what's up with them glasses, what'cha eye kinda lazy?
Anyways we gotta clean that shit up out the backseat
But first what's up with that blonde, you think she
likes black meat?

[Shock G]
She said she was a virgin to the brown, never splurged in the town
But she's down, 'cause you got her all moist, like the Rolls Royce backseat
'Least I can do is help you clean it up cousin
What time is mom and dad comin'?

[Humpty Hump]
Yo, why y'all bein' responsible and shit? We gotta hook up
We tryin' to get these chicks upstairs, see what we can cook up
One of them got their toes blue, coochie shaved, so cool
My nose tryin' to be with those when the doors close fool

[MURS]
Exactly. Fuck the backseat I'm tryin' to smack cheeks
Until they turn reddish, and satisfy my fetish
Lay back and get some lettuce (Humpty: Yo, what'chu mean, head?) (Yeah)
That's what I said, then call it a wrap (Shock: But what about your parents?)
Well, they never called me back, I guess their flight got delayed
So we got time to get layed, ayo Hump could you watch out for that white Escalade?
(Humpty: Did you even have to ask?) Well since you're on the task
I'ma head upstairs and get focused on some ass
And if I start to scream, do your best to ignore me
If my parents come in, just tell them the Burger King story
Just keep 'em entertained until I finish gettin' brained
(Humpty: Hello Ms. Connor, he's gettin' drained) And the name is Elaine

[Chorus 2X]

      [Intro]
People feelin' that. Oh man. One two one two. I smell somethin' cookin'
Yeah yeah yeah. Okay, give us freedom. That's for real for real
Turn it up a little more G. That means turn it up fool
Yeah, this is it. Yeah yeah. 9th

[Chorus]
I'm free
To change the world to change the times
I'm free
To change my life to change my mind
I'm free
To have hope to have new ideas
I'm free to live my life without the pressure of my peers
I'm free
To make a choice to take a chance
I'm free
To take my voice and make a stance
I'm free
And now I know why the caged bird sings
I'm free to be me so let me do my thing
I'm free

[Verse One]
Like a fresh out of county no bond
Bout to get some Fat Burger and go see my moms
Like the health care need to be
The fact that it ain't is just obscene to me
Free is a state of mind a state to live
Can't be selfish, people hate to give
Love, worth more than gold
But it's free and it's got to be part of soul
Told, I was free 1863
That's until I got clipped by the LAPD
Free to be oppressed for 400 years
Free to leave this country free to stay right here
To make a difference
Free to make change
Free to be normal while I'm free to be strange
From every mountain top where they let freedom rang
There was freedom in the songs that my ancestors sang

[Chorus]

[Verse Two]
Like I'm tax exempt
Free to knock out gangstas and smack some pimps
Cause I'm free to be a whole lot more than that
Free to see the whole world and be more than black
Free to be a plain ole human being
I'm free to write songs about the wrongs I seen
I'm free to make a buck at anyone's expense
Do what it takes to make my rent
But no act will ever be free of consequence
It don't cost a dime to use your common sense
It's Free like Will when I'm free to kill
Anybody that try to knock...
Let me chill
I'm free from anger, I'm free from it
When they grab a hold of me
It's free I break
I'm free to be a failure
Free to be great
And I'm free to be the one who decides my fate

[Chorus]

[Verse Three]
Like my style was in '93
Now there's a whole bunch of dudes tryin' to rhyme like me
Work hard young man
Homie grind like me
And you can be whatever you wanna be
Like the blood, like the love of Jesus
Like the love that the Koran teaches
Like space and the outer reaches
Can't Arrest my Development I'm free like Speech is
Like a genie
Fresh out the bottle
When these MCs is free not to be role models
And me
Well, I'm free to be one
Free to fix a problem where ever I see one
The government came to my hood with free guns
Got us all scared, now I'm thinkin' I need one
But I'm free from fear
And if you already free then let me hear you say "YEAH!"

      Fo Da Money

     <lyrics>
      [Boots]
Ahhhhhhh yesss, ah-heh
Tell me somethin
Were you, about to make a decision?
Was it, one of... THOSE decisions?
Ya know, when ya, gotta decide, between
what's good, for you, and what's good, for the struggle
Well before you sellout, The Coup wants to tell you a lil' story
E-Roc, kick it

[E-Roc]
Pressure, is gettin to my dome
See, I need some food for my little boy's tummy
Pulled up a chair just to think about my situation
Don't have a job, cause jackin is the occupation
FUCK THE SYSTEM, you know that it's all wrong
I got my gauge, yeah now my mission's on
Checked on my baby, good he was sound asleep
Cause money was my thoughts as I began to creep
down the street the corner sto', was on my mind
Freeze! with the sounds of clips was in my behind
I turned around but befo' I could pull my trigger
in they ass, on the ground, laid another nigga
I was trippin, slippin labelled as a dummy
But can you blame me, I did it for da mo-ah-money

*chorus*
M-O-N, N-E-Y (repeat 2X)
Broke as a; broke as a sucka!
(repeat all 4X)

[E-Roc]
Back on the streets I thought I wouldn't survive
So I'm bustin my ass on this nine to five
Flippin patties all day when the place is hot
Gettin paid peanuts, in the burger shop
Now everybody wants to know the deal, is this brother real
can I feed my family off of a Happy Meal?
I had to stop cause this shit ain't for E-Roc
I threw down my time card and started slangin rocks
For a brother dis is some'in you can't beat
My cash is flowin, now I'm bringin home the meat
I'm feelin good sellin crack to a fiend
Don't give a fuck about his luck, ya know what I mean?
People trip, but they don't understand that
a devil's land, ain't no black foe a black man
Now it's a shame, but who's to blame?
I got a baby with a life and no future to gain, yeah the money

*chorus*

[E-Roc]
I remember the time when I was six
The American Dream was everybody gets, rich
But yo, a fact for all to know
Four hundred years has passed, and we still po'
He ain't my Uncle, but Sam know what he's talkin about
If you wanna get paid, sell your people out
But not me I'd rather do a crime
Deep in my rhyme; is it better for a black man to do time?
To the red white and blue I don't give a fuck
Because I live and die, just to make a buck
So I'm that mother-fucker
That rob his daddy, and threw his ass in the gutter
And I'm that fool
that sold his kids cocaine at school
But Jack's an attorney
So I'ma do what I do, cause he's makin all the motherfuckin...
*gun shots*

[Boots]
I believe.. truthfully, we all gonna die someday
So, die hustlin for yourself
or die hustlin for millions of your people
The choice is yours, choose your fate
You can get with this, or you can get with that
We out

      chorus
i get it done
make it one make it two make it three
right before it happens
make it four make it five make it 6 7 8 9
ten
come  on motherfucka we can do it again
repeat

See i aint never had shit
but  my strife and my game and my life
and all thems is just hand downs from my granddaddy lidvens
for them whose black folks ever came to here
to steal and hustling food stamps for that nine to 4 caddy
how many days can i stretch this box of grits
shit never quits im a brother
pitching fits or pitching shit
i use my mouth or a leg muscle anything to make the rent,
yo give up the hustle.
I know the us economy and i could run it
im about to make these four dollars into 4 hundred
aint nothing  happening but this serious game
while they got billions in the bank
we just got money on the deck
and when we got fresh rims we on top,
on top of what when the kitchen's table's on hock
gun uncocked but we seen it on the past
make a fast dash for the cash be gangsta leaning on your ass
twentys and tens its all about making ends
no need to sin to uplift a california living
but i'd rear cos err i remember as a tot mr ogs
skank you motherfuckars with the glocks
and now the rocks is in my pockets
and my spots hot like the haiwaiian tropics
a taskforce topic cos this one's a cya
even though the yay is brought in by the cia
see im a motherfuckas thats done some dirt for my meal ticket
but i learned quit you gots to deal with it
well i dealed for twentytwofucking years
you damn straight my homies been laid when we all shed a tear
and its clear to my ear i had to learn that knowledge
cos after 12th grade i had to say fuck college
and the knowledge no longer will i waste my time
the chrome was stuck in my ear
but im stuck to the ground
im steady mobbing
back to the police station,
they checking me but its inflation thats doing this  taking
no hesistating cant be waiting let me do my thing
i was hooked like a fiend but now im hip to tha skeme


chorus


i heard recognized game when its in your face
im spitting the game so close to you
you could feel the wet trace
if everybody in the hood had a phd
youd  say that dr flip that burger hell it good for me
200thousand brothers watching one mind one place to go
aint no revolution they just walking to the liquor store
here take a swigger so its quicker round the niggerroe
just wanna get rich the rigamole i been here before
a typical ho aint really no different
except that she would know that caint no prostitute
can become a pimp up in this system
it'd be more drama than a soap opera daytime spot
but aint no twist up in this cemetery plot
since nineteen fiftyfour
i's been hustling for that dough
my girl been putting out cross that wick like she's a specialized pro
this shit is getting steep
im getting ill ready to kill
the only thing i can inherit is an overdue bill
now its six in the morning
i stride to the ride
as i glide down the street
i cant  get to park ?
cos my gas is kissing heat
im not yet free
but you dont hear me though
unlesss you creeping soap as my drive through window
now if you wondering bout my fucked up fickle frown
is cos im thinking bout how the wealth dont trickle down
listen to that beat nickle pound is my homies in the back
pass the nickle bag around and im looking at the street
through the fogged up windows knowing if i was walking
id be smelling stench or piss or stale pussy in your window
i ask when those stores get closed down
a system that eats itself got it looking like a ghost town
no proof of purchase hear my essence purchase proof
analyze how they fucked us like if i was dr ruth
im on proof with the truth they started with nothing
robbed and ganked and killed
aint no po folks getting rich
less some caps is getting picked
except for a couple of motherfuckas who done live their
token seen lifestyles of the rich and famous
front page of the magazine but that's a known
trick tell them suck their own dick
im hip to the skeme
my fist will bring up the whole clique.

      Breakthrough
     </title>
     <lyrics>
      [Sample]
What do we do baby

[Intro]
Yeah. I just want to announce right now
that I am the realest rapper in the whole world
cause I got my momma in here with me.

[Verse One]
New face of America
You fools lack character
The first dude to pick up the mic and embarrass ya
Bare facts
I'm tearing up tracks
Ya game ain't there homie
Just lay back
Relax
Kick up your feet
And watch the world rock to this new beat
I'm talkin' bout peace
I'm talkin' bout change
Ain't talkin' bout beef
Ain't talkin' bout chains
I represent the streets from whence I came
Never been a loser
Don't need no gangs
Don't need no guns
I take these drums
And make the darkest day of your life seem fun
Lovin' life
I plug in mics
And show the mainstream that these thugs ain't tight
I'm twice the man that these boys will never be
MURS 3:16
Legendary MC

[MURS Speaking]
I've been around man and I'm gonna be around till I'm gonna be around
So when you see me around, respect me

[Chorus]
What do we do baby?
And if you just breakthrough
And you must breakthrough
And you must breakthrough
And you must breakthrough
And you must breakthrough
And if you just breakthrough
And you must breakthrough
And you must breakthrough
And you must breakthrough
And you must breakthrough

[Verse Two]
Man the truth will set you free just give it a try
You ain't truly livin' if you livin' a lie
Naw
Man I swear to God
There ain't never been a rapper on the earth this hard
I love my momma
Stay away from the drama
Try to work my way through it if I ever had a problem
I say my prayers to the man upstairs
And if G's go to Heaven then I gotta be there

[MURS Speaking]
Look. Rest in peace Derick Martin. 45. Tamiko. I'ma see you when I get there

[Chorus]

[Verse Three]
I'm in love right now and it feels so good
To find a girl like mom and you wish you could...
Say I'm so soft
Say I ain't hood
Say it to my face, man I wish you would
And I'm smilin' in the press
Got all this money and you lookin' so depressed
Angry and mad
Man, I'm happy as hell
Might get a job if this record don't sell

[MURS speaking]
What? Burger King? McDonalds? Better yet, Best Buy or Target
At least I'll get a discount

[Verse Four]
Oh well, I'll be employee of the month
You'll never see your boy on the tube with gold fronts
That ain't me
It never was
You gotta do you and let it do what it does
I'ma be happy
Fame won't trap me
Catch me doin' this for the money then slap me
There's more to life
I'm better than that
I'm trying to lift you up instead of settin' you, settin' you back (echos)

[MURS Speaking]
It's good game man. I wouldn't tell you nothing that wasn't good for you though
That wasn't going to help you grow.

[Chorus]

[Outro]
This is MURS and 9th Wonder signin' off
And you know we do it, we do, we do it realistic
So, it's his wife and my momma and my girlfriend and we goin' home
That's it. No party, no after party, no Crystal, no hoes
Just me and my morano, goin' home

      Lyrical Murderers
     </title>
     <lyrics>
      "This is the life, we gone!" - Royce Da 5'9"
"I ain't with the leanin and rockin
That ain't even seen as a option..." - Joe Budden

[Intro: Crooked I] + (Kay Young)
You're nothin without +Focus+
Woo.. Long Beach (lay your seats back)
New Jersey (turn your speakers up)
Brook-lyn! Detroit!

[Chorus: Kay Young]
We-we, we lyrical murrrrrrrrrrrderers
Welcome to the Slaughterhouse
(What you talkin 'bout?)
Where we bring them verbal llamas out, bloaw
We-we, we lyrical murrrrrrrrrrrderers
Man, we own these streets
And the freaks they love us
We ain't worried 'bout you fuckers (Slaughterhouse)

[Crooked I]
Lyrical murderer, blame Rakim
I'm a sniper shootin my way into your lame top 10
Pistol at your head if I ain't next to Eminem
Then I bust in your face like I'm fuckin Lil' Kim
Niggaz better pray to the lyrical lord
that I fall off like the umbilical cord before I fill up the morgue
This is how a killer record
with the double-edged triple syllable sword, I'm iller than all
Dineri, see I'm a literary genius
Bury niggaz with words, a cemetery linguist
Most rappers are comedy gold
They like they boyfriend's sodomy hole - they full of SHIT!

[Royce Da 5'9"]
Now you could walk through the shadow of death next to that shady street
Where the verbal cocaine business and 80's meet
Where them niggaz is backwards
I'm ridin with my daughter in the front with the A.K. in the baby seat
We them copycat killers, unleashin venom
Commit them lyrical murders and then we re-commit 'em
Lyrics be high quality
Bitches be givin me brain, my dick be deep in they heads like psychology
Independently pennin the best words that were ever said
The mixture of Leatherhead and Everclear
You can't hide, we everywhere
Now, picture a grizzly standin next to a teddy bear

[Chorus]

[Joe Budden]
Yeah
Hello hip-hop, I am here, you dyin yeah and I'm aware
A beast so at your wake I'll cry lion's tears
And that's no disrespect to the pioneers
If we ain't who you tryin to hear
Somethin either wrong with your eyes and ears
I came in this game screamin Jers'
Ain't an MC in our lane to try and merge
Try and run with our wave
But I'm cool with bein Eddie Levert seein my son on stage
Gun gon' blaze, act up in this joint
And I'ma be Nate Robinson and back up the point
Your run's over, run with us or get run over
I'm here to save this shit, and I brung soldiers

[Joell Ortiz]
This is lyrical murder
Me and every track have a physical merger
When I stab it in the chest I'ma bit of a curver
So it bleeds to death, like the middle of a unfinished burger
Or sometimes I wrap my hand around his throat
Cause he think his kick is slick or his little snare is dope
Shoot the bass in the face but sometimes I carry a rope
to hang the piano keys when they hittin every note
I'm what no beat's able to withstand
If you suffer from writer's block and your label got big plans
Listen to this fam
Slide a little dough out that budget, and hire the instrumental hitman

[Chorus]

      Terrorist Pirateships
     </title>
     <lyrics>
      [sample]
The fighter bombers striked the ships with their cannons
Dropped conventional ammunitions and napalm on the ship
Repeatedly from stim to stern
After the marages have done their work, the ship was hit by medium bomber
They saw missiles and, carrying napalm and other ammunitions like white fossils

[Intro: Bomshot (Dom Pachino)]
Warghosts, Dom Pachino
Let's get it popping, Napalm, Napalm, what
(Terrorist shit, Terrorist shit)

[Bomshot]
The Prince of Persia, no fingerprints on the burner
Since the murder, I had the corpse of Mr. Burger
The risen great forgiveness, amongst sex and sinners
At thankful dinners, we discuss Satan's business
Italian Stallion, solid rose gold medallion
My whole battalion, calling ours to Long Island
Or mighty God Allah, perfect the favors upon me
The greats of wisdom, that I might be sent out to warn thee
Fucking with me, you better just shoot me
I leave you with loose teeth, have you bleeding profusely
My rhymes devour, you fucking with a higher power
I'm a sky tower, I hit you with a fire shower
I'm kind of on the horror side, take you on a drama ride
Father homicide, the reason why your mama died
Fuck a state trooper, I shoot you with bazookas
While you dwell on my past, I'm looking forward to your future
I'm a walking zombie, bad omens always haunt me
I'm a beast coming out of this game like Jumanji
Make you taste the hellfire, sacred faith of L vile
Vampires yell siren, pawn entering my empire
The clock strikes twelve, L's got wells around they wells
Where I dwell, I got mad shells, filled with skulls
To sell, my frontline's covered with empty shells
My neighbors getting suspicious from all the funny smells
Thugs wanna bang to it, hustlers wanna slang to it
I wanna go to South Bay, throw me in the gang unit
I'm dying for the day to pour, Satan from his dome
So I can build my kingdom out of fire and brimstone

[Holocaust]
I go where there is darkness, always hit the target
Ghost ships voyages, I climb inside and explode the starship
It it written, for Godly sorrow work his appentice
His salvation, not to be repented off, but to saw off the world worker's death
I leave nothing left, your rhyme is facing a natural disaster when
something crept
Fathom with help from a rag tag team of soldiers
A scientist makes a last stand on Earth against an invasion by phantom
And explosions, I break speak records at high speeds
Gorilla war machines, capture and hunt you in a labirynth
Conspiracy within a night scene
Clash of the warriors standing near the invisible ninja family
There is a man who thinks the government is trynna cover up a UFO landing
I blow a pistol like John Henry Holiday to blow you all away
The expirations of pirate ships in space, you die in this modern day
I am heard by people in the middle of nowhere
The metropolis dawns, before the evening an atomic bomb blows there
Firearms kill revolutionaries, music and time travel device
I body slide, leaving your skull in the ice

[Dom Pachino]
Frozen, brittle from corrosion
Explosions, to the foes that think they know 'em
And in the mouths of dirty bitches that wanna throw 'em
I got a hook, I'm the captain of the ship, when I'm rapping
I got a patch on my third eye and I can still see what's happening
Visual, lyrical craftman, real good soldiers, I staff 'em
Load 'em in, my war craft and blast 'em
Off to the Terror zone, where they learn to leave the dirt alone
And my cream rise to the top like foam, stone the devil
Make 'em experience what Jesus went through, repent too
That's the reason why they sent you, a firely hell
With a gross smell of human flesh, left to die a thousand deaths
My pirate ship full of scoundrels, that drink brews by the barrel
Chain up pharaohs and make 'em sing Christmas carols
For entertainment, mental enslavements the payment
You can't sustain it, observe it, obsorb it, maintain it
I doubt it, so much pain, I make them shout it
They talk shit about master Dom P, but ain't bout it, bout it
I'm so inspired, I make your whole team retire
Real talk, true story, liar liar
I set your track on fire, I wet you up
I'm spiteful, deviant, I even set you up
Make 'em repeat after me, In Terrorist We Trust

      Go Head
     </title>
     <lyrics>
      (*talking*)
I'm the truest to do it, I'm the truest to do it
I'm the truest to do it - 4x
Yeah, you in the presence of the truest
Chamillitary nigga, what up Rasaq let's get this mayn hol' up

[Hook - 4x]
Go-go, go-go
Go-go 'head, go 'head

[Chamillionaire]
A Texas legend, with the most lyrical style
Single hook is spitted, ain't always bout a freestyle
We don't try to be pals, don't wanna holla at me now
You should write a book, and call it how to be down
You asking why do we clown, cause I'm the truth i look in the mirror and say thank ya
For being the only rapper, that'll admit you ain't a gangsta
I know you gon love, how vivid the picture is I paint ya
You feeling like you a realer nigga than me in your heart, ain't ya
I tried to warn him, but I kept getting the cold shoulder
They thinking they flows colder, too late they got rolled over
You Destiny's Child, now ya feeling it no soldier
My nigga ya no Hova, you really got no flow brah
For pumping that plastic crack, out of my trunk
And I jump in when them majors tell me to jump, let it bump
Yeah I'm valedictorian, nigga I'd never flunk
Ashton Kutcher, pussy ass niggaz get punked ha-ha
I was with the House, but I wasn't feeling the vibe
You could interview me, I ain't got nothing to hide transaction denied
I'm a flame-thrower, why do these suckers get fried
When they ask him bout me, he must of replied...
You gotta love me, nigga I swallow my pride
Them records were dissing me, but I let beef slide
I might let you slide, but watch yourself or we gon have to collide
And that's the last warning, then I'll re-ride

[Hook - 4x]

[Rasaq]
Society said I'm a menace, but it isn't cause I'm O-Dog
It's because my froze jaw, got your vision thoed off
Show you how a pro floss, when it comes to the dentist
Before I finish the sentence, they asking how much did them hoes cost
I spit on Paul Wall, cause you know you so soft
Friendly ass teddy bear, step up and get broke off
You a bopper, why you riding niggaz dicks
How you a "chick magnet", you no different from a bitch
Hoe sider dick rider, you a Nawf and Southsider
You a dick-sucker partna, open up your mouth wider
We can go toe to toe, one on one with no gun
Put your head in your glass, till you looking at the sun
You use to read the bible, trying to give a nigga hugs
Only punched me from behind, when you jumped me in the club
Not a scratch not a scar, not a cut not a smudge
Nigga use to go to church, now you wanna be a thug
You went from Gulfbank to 4-4, to 5-9 Southlea
Trying to fit in, so you grill and show your mouthpiece

(*talking*)
It's Rasaq boy, you know my brother told me to chill out
But you way too fake for all that boy, you know
I see you by yourself, and you ain't trying to do nothing
You know I'm saying, I see ya in the club and you trying to jump me
Know I'm saying ha-ha, with bout five other dudes with your boys or whatever
You know I'm saying, so the funny thang about that is
This fool is only punching me in the back, like a lil' gal or some'ing
You know I'm saying, and you been shooting too many slugs boy I hear you
You know I'm saying so, you ain't shooting no mo' slugs this way
Without taking no charge back, you feel me ha-ha
Now you wanna be a G, now you wanna sip the bar and blow the dro
And you was a grown man in your 20's, wearing Sponge Bob watches from Burger King
I seen you in the Source man, don't try to front like you wasn't
And all y'all old fans y'all know, this boy is rapping bout Gucci tampons
And diamonds in his bugers, you know I'm saying
And finally you a G, you use to claim the Northside
Now you tal'n bout you on 5-9 of Southlea, no disrespect to Southlea
You know I'm saying, but Paul Wall you a perpetrator, you ain't from there

     <lyrics>
      Uh huh, yea, uh uh, what ya want from me?
Uh huh, yea, Half-A-Mill, y'all know
First don, yea, uh huh, holla

[Verse 1]
Legendary don, cherries flowin in Parion
Platinum Champaign glass yea thats Half-A-Million
Lay back, laughin at these rap new jacks
Yappin 'bout how they slung a few cracks
and touch a few stacks
use to come through on the max
now all of a sudden you sealed out
crew cat, now you shoot back
Fake ballers, let Mill show y'all where hoop at
Get real, here I come head for the hills
Nigga my ooz strap, my first single is Rata-tat-tat
Kill every nerve in you, action packed you might need plastic bag
I mack hoes like hack-a-sack jack
spit tight flows, 23 inches on on the white Rove
They tryin to hear you oversize chips
On my right lobe, oversize clips light oversize spiffs
put my oversize dick 'tween your bitch oversized lips
Five or six, no matter what you whip
You ain't fly as this

[Chorus: Half-A-Mill] **repeat 2X**
From the Range to the Rove to the Bentley Coupe
Back the V-12 for being buggy niggaz salute
We be them Mill-i, pretty thugs guns we shoot
So when you see us don't say "wuttup" niggaz salute

[Verse 2]
Fuck you starin for? frontin off in front of camera floor
My name Milli, chicks feel me like brand new soar
I make a brand new hall maybe like brand new eloar
If niggaz wanna front dawg I got the brand new four
I pop a cannon off, lay you in brand new floor
I ain't tryin to play you dawg, I just spray you dawg
Live motivator, why's is hole in paper?
no respect for the dead send my guys to hold your wake-up
French fries ass, cheese burger frontin like you fly ass
Words on the street you bitch niggaz gon' die fast
So I advise you hop on your CL K and drive fast
No set-ups then I just wet-up your dry ass
Act like you fed-up, "ok, uh huh, shut up ass"
Street vet, heat rep show you how to develop cash
Hella stash, keep the Calico on hella blast
Hella stash, keep my Calico on hella blast

[Chorus: Half-A-Mill] **repeat 2X**

[Verse 3]
I got no love, thats why niggaz got no liver
Let the fed figure why you got thrown in the river
I'm thorough bred put the extended metal to your head
Chicks say I'm a sex symbol, pop you like your next pimple
Your righteous? I'mma step to your Temple
Cut your legs off dawg leave you walkin off thimbles
Now hop over the candle stick dick lets see if your nibble
I'mma like an evil Hindu, Knievel, Willy's 6-50 through
Illmatic, Bill Matic, peel ratchets, still at it
Most of y'all niggaz is still faggots
Open up your ass cheek you prolly leak ill maggots
Real madness, thats why I keep steel for you bastards
In the Million Man March against me -- get a million caskets
I'm hear to spark niggaz and piss on your ash's
Retaliatin be the next thug missin in action
Whoeva want it they can get slugs I'm dissin off Magnums

[Chorus: Half-A-Mill] **repeat 2X**

[Outro: Half-A-Mill]
Mill Latin, uh hu Ali Baba, yea

      * originally heard on the "Super Sir Loin" episode

[Intro]
For the shorteez! (Doin it for the shorteez)
For the shorteez! (Doin it for the shorteez)
For the shorteez! (For the shorteez)

[mc chris]
For the shorteez - gather 'round and let me tell ya somethin
For the shorteez - can't you hear them little stomachs rumblin?
For the shorteez - yo you gonna eat that raggamuffin?
For the shorteez - let's show the shorteez some lovin
C'mon, my name is Sir Loin, been at this for a while
I got four stomachs for only one stomach and mouth
That's a little empty belly with the vacancy sign
Kinda like close encounters of the charity kind
Ya got canned goods, just collectin dust
Ya got meat, got fruit, got vegetables
Only prerequisites that can set a bowl
Get ya freak on at my freaky food festival
Cold cuts a must, I'll even take bread crust
Cause the shorteez be beggin, some beggars don't give a {fuck}
They's hungry~! Let's face facts, they starvin
Feel a void in your heart, fill ya shoppin cart
for the shorteez

[Chorus]
For the shorteez! (For the shorteez, y'all)
For the shorteez! (For the shorteez)

[mc chris]
Think at what's at stake, look upon your plate
If it's a slab o' steak, time to regurgitate
You got a double chin? Well Little Jim's too slim
Your fingers could fit in the little kid's exposed ribs
Just think of all the shorteez, can't ya hear 'em cry?
Paula, cough up that burger and fries
Hams on my left, double cans, Bob's got high
Give to the hungry shorteez, so the shorteez won't die
Stop the famine please, instead of eatin ham and cheese
Throw away your greens, you be pissin on their dreams
Gimme all your onion rings, it's aight listen
A slice of pizza, it don't matter if a bite's missin!
Prime rib, porkchop, porterhouse, it don't stop
Stop actin like hogslop, to the shorteez it's a lot
They been hungry since birth, so hand over your desert
Open up your mouth, stick a finger down, it could be worse
Listen closely, gimme all your groceries
Cause a little baby's screamin "Man, I need a hoagie!"
"Somebody hold me, somebody console me
Somebody boil me up a pot o' pierogis!"
Think of what we're facin', all those little faces
C'mon it's a race it's... for the shorteez (Check it out)
Doin it for the shorteez {*3X*}
(Doin it for the shorteez, y'all!) For the shorteez!

[mc chris]
Got crackers, got chips, got puddin cups
You'd be surprised what little shorteez like to munch
Could be trash, could be mold, could be excrement
Could be a bag o' old diapers, they'd call that lunch
Mayonnaise been out for a couple o' days
Milk and corpses, scabs and eggs
Sweet bread, pig heads, horse heads, too
Wanna drop it like it hot? Here's what ya do
(For the shorteez!) 6-1-2 Wharf Avenue, what?
6-1-2 Wharf Avenue, what?
(For the shorteez!) 6-1-2 Wharf Avenue, what?
6-1-2 Wharf Avenue

But please, no more candy yams, man, seriously man
We got more candy yams than we know what to do with
MC Pee Pants in the h... I mean uhh
Sir Loin's in the house, and I'm out~!!

      I'm Hittin' Hard
     </title>
     <lyrics>
      Ladies and gentlemen
Gentlemen and ladies
Adults teenagers adolescents and babies
No if's and's but's or maybe's
I want the whole world to rock today
Because I said I was and always was
The baddest rapper on the mic and I proved it does
Make a difference
On the way you think you syn-
Cronize the wise tries
To overcome the dumb the drum
Beats a pattern that turns into
A catalyst that'll just
Grab your ear you had to hear
A rhyme's contents
Beyond nonsense
If you're not convinced
Get tense and wince
Cause I'll make a skeptic
Look epileptic
Shake and brake like the Holy Ghost connected
His body and soul
I control
His mind is mine cause my
Rhyme holds
Minds in limbo
You resemble
A clone of Jim Jones as them bones tremble
Shakin' like a leaf in disbelief
No chatterin' teeth
Can cease pity or grief
I got you flipping like a burger
Head spinning like a top
Weak at the knees
And you're about to drop
You can't find your heart
You need a warrant to search
Get off your knees
Boy this ain't church
You can pray if you wanna pray
Say what you wanna say
Did you forget you was ambiguous
You're gonna pay
For doubting my rhyme
You better freeze your thought
Cause I read minds
If you got caught
I taught
Lessons for second-guessing
Reroute doubt
I reprogram and deprogram about
Two million fans
Through rhytmic hypnosis
Left in a state
Of cataclysmic neurosis
Neurotic from a narcotic
Known as rhyme
Addicted to rap
And you're a fiend for mine
For my rap info
You're a nympho
I'll raise the conscience
And then hit them so hard with the rhyme
I'ma leave you scarred
Cause I don't just hit ya
I hit ya hard
I weave the bob
To do the job
Set you up with the left
As the right writes hard
Lyrics stick and move
Behind the groove
As the beat gets better
The rhyme improves
Adversaries prepare for a telling loss
Bring a stretcher nurse and the smelling salts
My rhyme is more
Than a fight or a bout
You ain't goin' down
Boy you're goin' out
No count necessary
Cause you ain't gettin' up
Bad mouthin' ends very
Very very abrupt
Thought patterns converted
Through overt overtures
Prepared your mind
Much better for metaphors
More rap classics
Believe me there's no man
Not Bach Brahms Beethoven or Chopin
Polonaise would ever faze ya
Like I faze ya I amaze ya
Ali and Fraizer I
Get deja vu from listening to
The rhymes that cut like an uppercut
And rings a bell too
I come out smoking
Hard from the first round
Stinging like a bee
And the bell is the worst sound
Cause I don't wanna let up
If you can get up
I'm fed up
The rhymes are sped up
To mess your head up
When the rhyme is over
They tally the scorecard
I get more points
Cause you hit the floor hard
But I'm hittin' hard
The very last thing
That you remember
Is a rhyme in your face
And the crowd yell timbre
Then you fall in a dopefiend nod
Cause I don't just hit ya
I hit ya hard
When I rain
It's more like a hurricane
You wanna dis
Then think of another name
Cause I go to work
And my rhymes slam
Put me to the test
You'll fail the exam
Cause that's the kind of test
You just can't study for
You're guaranteed
To end up bloody or
Broken twisted
Fractured blistered
Decapitated mutilated
Violated it's the
Kind of defeat
That you just can't live with
Try to compete
But you just can't get with
The Mental Master
Hard-ryhme supremist
My words have ya
Mixed like a chemist
My rhymes flow like
H-2-O
Cleaned with chlorine
To make green so
The rhyme is purified
You can't drink it
Biters and suckers
Don't even think it
The green I made
Is a money shade
When the rhyme evaporates
I get paid
Then it's time to rain
With the rhyme I know
And like plants
Watch my people grow
I heal sick minds
Like Christ himself
Touch the soul
Like no one else
There's only one
President Pope and one God
There's only one rapper
In that class
And I hit ya hard

      Bridgette
     </title>
     <lyrics>
      (N.W.A. talking about Brigette)

There once was a girl I knew named Bridgette
She asked me was my dick a grown man or a midgette
Of course I had to show her all my balls, ring ding-aling
I whipped out my whopper but we wasn't at Burger King
Nuthin' more said, she grabbed it like a vice grip
And as the D.O.C. do you mind if I nibble this? No.
I took her to the back of the studio
And, she ate up on the doc like a Cheerio
I told the bitch yo please don't bite me
Then she made me scream when she grabbed the balls tightly
So I slapped the bitch for goin' out like a sucka
My dick was in her mouth so she bit the motherfucka
To make her stop I pulled up on her extensions
And left jimmy standin' at attention
The look in my eyes said "Bitch you are gonner"
Now I think back to the day I should a peed on her

Bridgette, Bridgette, was a girl that I knew, but,
Bridgette was a dumb ho, Bridgette was a dumb ho
Bridgette, Bridgette, was a girl that I screwed, but,
Bridgette was a dumb ho, Bridgette was a dumb ho

So ya know Bridgette called me the next day
Just to apologize so I said OK
She claims she wants to make it up to the D.O.C.
And ya know I'm still out to get the pussy
Tried to be nice cause I didn't want to dis her
Passed Mickey D's and went to the Sizzler
Ordered the food she started rubbin' on my knees
Then I could tell that she wanted to fuck me
She said lets get dinner and I had a fit
At ten dollars a plate I said fuck that shit
Yo, that's the main reason our relationship was for me
Why, cause Bridgette was too fuckin' horny
She said please excuse me for a minute
To powder my nose I said yeah I'm with it
She took a long time the food came and I'm chewin'
Thinkin' to my self what the fuck is she doin'
Went to look for her and I heard screamin'
Looked in the room and the waiters were teamin'
Up on a bitch like it ain't no thang
But then I flipped cause it was Bridgette gettin gang banged

Bridgette, Bridgette, was a girl that I knew, but,
Bridgette was a dumb ho, Bridgette was a dumb ho
Bridgette, Bridgette, was a girl that I screwed, but,
Bridgette was a dumb ho, Bridgette was a dumb ho
Bridgette, Bridgette, Yo Dre, That nigga screwed the bitch too, but,
Bridgette was a dumb ho, Bridgette was a dumb ho
Bridgette, Bridgette, I'd wear a rubber if I were you, yo,
Bridgette was a dumb ho, Bridgette was a dumb ho

So you know Bridgette called me the next day
Just to apologize so I said OK
She claims she wants to come over and see me
And do anything to fuck the D.O.C.
She said she loves me but I didn't say loved her
Went to the store and got me some rubbers
Then I made a phone call up to the guys
Boy this bitch is in for big suprise
When she came in put on a slow record
Said a few lines and the bitch got naked
Laid her on the bed and told her suck my dick
Then ran Eazy, Cube, and Dre out the closet
Turned her ass over, Laid the ho on her back
Then we rode the bitch like a mutherfuckin' Amtrack
Dre had the back and Eazy had the front
(I'm behind Ice Cube cause that's where the line started)
Bitch gettin' dogged by the doc and N.W.A.
Dogged the bitch out in each and every way
That's what I thought but with a girl Bridgette
The dumb ass ho, she liked this shit

Bridgette, Bridgette, was a girl that I knew, but,
Bridgette was a dumb ho, Bridgette was a dumb ho
Bridgette, Bridgette, was a girl that I screwed, but,
Bridgette was a dumb ho, Bridgette was a dumb ho
Bridgette, Bridgette, Yo Dre, That nigga screwed the bitch too, but,
Bridgette was a dumb ho, Bridgette was a dumb ho
Bridgette, Bridgette, I'd wear a rubber if I were you, yo,
Bridgette was a dumb ho, Bridgette was a dumb ho

[Intro: Little Bruce]
Ya know? Out there smashing them scrapers. Getting they papers. Sliding on
them groupie breezies... with the vapors. Yadamean? Scrape to this, my nig

[Verse 1: Little Bruce]
I cop me a 4-door Cutlass Sierra
For only 6 hun' the deal was done
The body straight and the engine run
... Hit the way, went did 121
It's great to see my boys in gold-tone rims
Plus some fresh new blades, 20 inches
Now I'm smoking fire, on Nitto tires
Hit my nig on his Motorola wire
My beat in the trunk, can you hook it up?
I'ma hit the sideshow, and cook it up
In a scraper? Nigga, I'ma make it spin
Hook up some nitrous and make it win
Four 15's with the TV-screens
Stock sunroof, I'm hella clean
Thought it was a 500-SCL
With the rims and beat, who could tell?
I'm riding thick man, smoking power
Reese in the back seat, tooting powder
Little Bruce, man, boss from the Villa
Clowning in my fresh whip, speed-bump-killer

[Hook: Little Bruce]
(I'm scraping) Scraper... Scraper... All about my paper
Siding on your haters, dark as Darth Vader
Scraping in my scraper, knock and bitch and rake her
I'm all about my paper, scraping in my scraper

[Verse 2: Turf Talk]
I'ma ride this bitch like a Benz (like a Benz)
Candy paint, 24-inch rims
... Love the soft leather on the clothing
And a lotta niggaz hating, but all the bitches show
And a lotta niggaz ride on my rims to keep balling
We gone pull up, get out, but keep going
Never mind Mito the dub, I'm tycooning
Gotta hit the supercharger when I make a move (err!)
Park in my new shit, hear me, courage
You can ride the blades on the gold tippy-toes (tippy-toes)
If you want attention, put a whistle on that hoe
Open the door, so wonderful, so cold
Sirens go while I diss the window (window)
You can get in if you like the indo (indo)
And Robin 'll be the personal pimp though (pimp though)
Holding the Kelly like hoes on hydro

[Hook: Little Bruce]
(I'm scraping) Scraper... Scraper... All about my paper
Siding on your haters, dark as Darth Vader
Scraping in my scraper, knock and bitch a rake her
I'm all about my paper, scraping in my scraper

[Verse 3: Little Bruce]
Cutlass, Pontiac, Chevy or Buick
I don't really give a fuck how you do it
Candy-apple-green, burgundy-wine
Tangerine... or the kiwi-lime
Put a dub on it and scrape to the O
Get a quarter-pound burger and shake to go
Roll one more while we looking for the show
It was still early so I scraped to the 'Sco
Nigga I'm Pretty Tony, going berserk
Hit the tenderloins and shake for work
Bitch, don't call without a rack or better
A pimp like me wanna see his cheddar
The same way you see yourself in my rims
Don't get dizzy, cause they don't stop spinning
Just found out where to get that Gucci
I'm finna be cleaner than a virgin's couchie

[Hook: Little Bruce] x2
(I'm scraping) Scraper... Scraper... All about my paper
Siding on your haters, dark as Darth Vader
Scraping in my scraper, knock and bitch a rake her
I'm all about my paper, scraping in my scraper

[Bridge: Little Bruce]
Scraping in my scraper, all about my paper
Siding on you haters, dark as Darth Vader
Scraping in my scraper, all about my paper
Knock and bitch a rake her, it's dubs on my scraper
Scraping in my scraper, all about my paper
Siding on your haters, dubs on my scraper

[Outro: Little Bruce]
Yeah. We doing the damn thang. What up. Don't forget, when you riding and
siding... We doing it like this: Scrape, scrape. Oh boy, it's big

      Tell Me
     </title>
     <lyrics>
      [Intro: Desert Eagle]
(Tell me... tell me...)
What would you do? Hillside Scramblers
Loose links, what would you?
Uh, check it, yo, yo, yo

[Desert Eagle]
I'm down for the get down, down wanna spit rounds
He started the beef, now, wanna split town
With the mark of the beast, thinkin' you the shit now
Four pound whippin' the flesh, better sit it down
Get it clown? You done started something
I put it down, and you just started hustlin'
Gettin' thirty off of a bundle, you project nothing
You'll get linked in a rumble, you project frontin'
Catch beef in the J's, it's project dumping
Test your heat when it blaze, better target something
Even my dick iced out, I be hard at fucking
Niggaz need to stop biting and try to market something
Niggaz need to start writing, your bark ain't nothing
Your tracks ain't hot, and your back don't function
Got the rap game locked, the crack game dumping
Got the crime scene hot, the club scene thumping, what?

[Chorus: Letha Face]
Tell me: what would you do?
If you was in my shoes and the nigga had the drop
Would you shoot first? Or get shot?
Or lift the earth from under his feet and make his boots rock
Tell me..

[Letha Face]
I can't stand it, people try to judge me
Especially the ones that said they love me, try to take me for granted
I been stranded with a mental block, sippin' expensive shots is hot
I could kiss the man who invented the glock
The thermometer pops burger, I stay on cock
So whenever my dogs call me, I'll be there, the end of story
Surrenders gory, close the book after the final chapter
Gradual bullets that travel faster than yacht masters
Hot ratchets that'll spin you, like a spinning top backwards
Cut your cabbage and turn it into coleslaw
I'm so raw, that my mom should of middle named me Diesel
These lethal bars perfected, can't be injected by needles
Breeding eagles out of Park Hill's hell hole
Where souls get sucked up, and shots turn your bones to Jell-o
Mellow tones with a stealth blow, under the bell's a four-four
The impact will crack an elephant's skull

[Chorus 2X]

[INF-Black]
I'm like the hallways you walk through, smokin' a blunt with a brew
The staircase you piss on, gettin' head on the roof
Ride down my elevator, you get punched in the tooth
My alligators hang loose from the front to the phone booth
I'm the concrete, the gates, the bars, gunnin' my goof
I'm the drugs, the money, the booze, and every rules
Fuckin' Betty who? Niggaz is petty, can get it to
Watch your mouth nigga, watch me, watch you
Like a movie, thought it was cool, how you wanted to do me
See me live with the snakes and get rid of them rats
I'm the fire in the lake, I burn faster than a match
But longer in a forest, at the speed of a mach
Spittin' out, bangin' off ground, I'm tearin' it down
There's never no fear in me, and they tellin' what's in me now
I've done tasted the dust, washed my face with the mud
Off with these clowns, my shoes is only made from my blood

[Chorus]

      Progress of Elimination
     </title>
     <lyrics>
      [Bo$$]
Who am I to flip a wicked Bitch?
Business is Business
But now the revelation has revealed
How the Bo$$ Bitch is trying to get rich!
And doing a good job
And rippin' up the pavement with 'nuff shit
Aww shit!!
I think I jumped into a maze
And now I'm being surrounded by dead niggaz in a daze
Some kind of way I have become a slave
Yes sir Masta
No sir Masta
I work fasta, even if it means my brain being tampered with
Fuck it!
At least I got rid of the pamper
Lata on I mix up with some G's
Kickin' it on the corner curb
Talkin' about expanding to Pittsburgh
I'm out here on the cut smokin' bud with Macaroni
Instead of us servin' niggas this fucka's tryin' to bone me
But I ain't trying to hear this Bitch made elf
I ain't in the mood
Cause I don't fuck around with the help bastard!
If it wasn't for the dope that we got stashed in the casket
I'd have your ass hit
Then watch the fool die trickin!
While I be countin' crispy ass dollars
Like Louisana fried chicken
And takin a sip of his favorite drink
At the grave as I stare through the shade
Your shit still stinks!
I wasn't tryin' to see an explanation
Cause as far as I'm concerned the only way to progress
Is through elimination!

Hook:
Got's to go yeah
Got to go
The Bo$$ no loss
What ever the cost
Elimination
Got's to go yeah
Got to go

[Bo$$]
Time is running out I'm still self employed
They talking this Pitt shit but I'm tryin to get back to DETROIT!
Fuck it if I need to do these niggas I'm a do 'em too
And step the fuck off as if I never knew them fools
See ya!
Now the shit is going my way
I'm hittin' the highway
No mo' drive by's
In my drive way
This is what's happening
I'm finally at my destination
I ain't one of 'dem bitches tryin'
I gotta get crackin' fuck a curling iron
I'll get that shit did lata
Meanwhile I'm on some ol'
Bucka a sucka quick shit fo paper and
I'm disectin' at the same time progressin'
Eliminating like a lunatic shootin quick
Call it what you want but I'll be brief
I don't trust a motha fucka
Unless a motha fucka is me g!
Getting' sweated is just an inspiration
So I don't regret it when you get your BC date
Cause it's all about elimination
(got to go yeah, got to go)
Fuck up and I'll have yo ass hitch hikin'
From Idaho Yo!
Bo$$ is knockin' out silly shit
Let me hit this philly spliff
Now it's time to really trip
I gettin the feelin' that these niggas
Is into my shit
Plus the muchies got me wanting a burger
But first the murder
Knockin' em off was a cinch but I'm stuck
And ain't no way that I'm a rest my head on
Another bench Fuck!
I'm sick of this shit
Let me slip into this alley
And try to fly as high as I can get
With 200 blunts and 100 spliffs
(tryin to make it to Detroit, Detroit)
Now every member of my click is in his grave
I'm truly the BO$$ bitch now
Nobody's slave!
How do I plea?
Listen! I'll neva give an explanation
Cause as far as I'm concerned
The only way to progress is through
Elimination!

Hook:

Gots to go yeah got to go
The BO$$ no loss
At whateva the cost
Elimination

      Ich Lebe für Hip Hop (Hip-Hop's What I Live For)
     </title>
     <lyrics>
      [Genius/GZA]
Wutang with graffiti on the wall in Berlin
Flash on the tooth (?) of the dangerous whirlwind
Rap flowing through a life wire, work for hire,
to apply, put the stronghold, restrict the tire
Set the alarm Germany dot com
Beneath the surface, illness sparked the bomb
That exploded while my Clan reloaded
We had to bring it to'em, truthfully, we owed it
Now we multiplied our stength on a worldwide note
We compact disk televised live quotes
Clear my throat with the greens bought from bulldog
Thick smog my memory kept it on by enough shows, murderous flows
Many photos, cameramen knocking their shit to catch a solo
Crowd hip hop well never wanna leave, always wanna hear more
Quick to explore
Flyin' thru space like a comet, DJ Tomekk, making you drunk niggaz vomit
Sling it to the Hip hop junkie from country to country
Mike whores swing like monkeys

Refrain (x3):

Ich lebe für Hip Hop
(check out my man)
Ich lebe für Hip Hop
(Wu-Tang Clan)

Curse
[English version]
I rap as optical, not even cinema comes close to that
Cause lots of fronters are tough on the outside and pussies inside like Lilo Wanders
I have a gob which adapts to any mic
Make my snippets, big tits, big eyes like in many Mangas
Dig the goldchains and Opel Mantas
The Ford Fiesta loony steps on the gas even on petrol
Loves the shit that makes many MCs sick
Home on every stage
I am gonna kill them even in the deepest forests
Get really into it even without it being a special occasion
Fancy Sri Lankian women and tangas, but favour bare asses
Stay strong even in tough times
You can diss my words if you like, but have to know that I get mean like that
Got the Stieber Twins with beatz to tell
Curse is the guy who asks to use your bathroom, only to paint the tiles with his Edding
Who moves on your daughter in singing cabins
And in red suites, still he's loved by mothers in law
Who mostly touches what people love
Who brandishes many
Who's got more brains than money on his bank
Who says peacefully that you are a really cool guy
No really, my style is standard
And until the music gives me more on my account
I stand in the queue in Burger King like a 7 of Spades,
to get fries even if it's bloody crowded
And if you let this man close to a mic,
the lights go out for all the other MCs, man

Yo, next
Peace
[German version]
Ich rap so optisch, nicht mal Kino kann das
Denn viele Fronters sind außen Hahn und innen Puss' wie Lilo Wanders
Ich hab n' Maul, das sich an Mikros anpasst
Mach meine Snippen, dicke Titten, große Augen wie in vielen Mangas
Steh auf Goldketten und no menos Mantas
Der Ford Fiesta Geisterfahrer que passe gibt im Benzin Standgas
Liebt den Scheiß, der viele MCs krank macht
Auf jeder Bühne Stammgast
Ich kill die Booter auch in den tiefsten Pampas
Lass mich gehen auch ohne Riesenanlass
Steh auf die Frauen Sri Lankas, auch gerne Tangas, doch am liebsten Blankarsch
Bleib in harten Zeiten ziemlich standhaft
Ihr könnt dissen so viele Worte ihr wollt, doch müsst wissen da bin ich fies veranlagt
Schnell mal Stieber Twins mit Beatz im Anschlag
Curse ist der Typ der nach'm Bad fragt und mit Edding deine Fließen anmalt
Deine Tochter in Gesangkabinen langmacht
In roten Suiten, doch immer angesagt bei Schwiegermamas
Der vieles anfasst was viele anmacht
Der viele brandnarbt
Der vielmehr Verstand hat als Kies auf Banca
Der für die Philly Blunt Arzt friedlich ansagt
Das du n' vollkorrekter Chah bist
Nee ehrlich, aber mein Stil ist Standard
Und bis die Muke mir Devisen reinkarrt
Steh ich wie Pik 7 bei Burger King für Pommes auch bei Riesenandrang
Und wenn dieser Mann an Mikros rankann
Geht das Licht aus für alle anderen MCs, Mann

Yo, Nächster
Peace Dann

Refrain

[Prodigal Sunn]
Across for Germany
Refery beeing bring Bloods
Keep we serve on the Alpuding Rats, the better Rock
Look Gentle with Tocks Janet do Panimal Cops
Several Base shell for talk to the Face
Here am Cuckaks(?) we rhyme for the Digic of Daks
Minterio, Stereo Universial Raps
Flodded with Flaks, I´m roll for the teens my bags
Who don`t case?, my Brothers from the Enemy Stakes
Writtin` Hip Hop Wu-Tang Clan is on the Man
We won´t stop, the A.S.T. greeding we Grace Machine (?)
We pops Blood on the scene we hut
Hip Hop some we live for the Seminom Rap!

Stieber Twins
[English version]
Ey yo, I thought of this flow as I took a leak
Knowledge is power
What I hate about Germany, is that every idiot makes a science out of rap
Hard as your old man after a hard day with a cardiac arrest, lying in the ditch,
never rising out of it again
At least, true enemies diss you in public
False friends get you to open up, and then fuck you over
Yet, we plan by day, and intervene by night
Shave your pussy ass, desinfect it with Schnapps sometimes
Works the other way around like a lawn mower that had its phases changed
When the two fat ones rap, the toilets at your jam will be empty, that much is guaranteed
What you want is to have the Stieber Twins in a king size bed, platonically, without sex
For you, hip hop is just a fashion joke
Admit, you're only at the set because there's money in the project
I am the one writing the lyrics, my brother provides the beatz
And between Heidelberg and Minden we give it to em all
Too alcohol in your arse, you'll sit your driving test again

[Geman version]
Ey yo, mein Flow beim Pissen erdacht, Wissen ist Macht
Was mich an Deutschland ankotzt
wenn jeder Spast aus Rap ne Wissenschaft macht
Hard wie dein Paps nach nem harten Tag und Herzinfarkt im Straßengraben
Lag aber nicht wieder erwacht
Wahre Feinde dissen dich wenigstens öffentlich
Falsche Freunde öffnen dich und ziehen dich ab
Doch wir planen am Tag, intervenieren bei Nacht
Rasieren deinen Scheißarsch, desinfizieren mit Schnaps manchmal
Läuft anders rum wie Rasenmäher mit Phasendreher
Wenn die zwei Dicken rappen sind auf deinem Jam oft garantiert die Toiletten leer
Was, ihr wollt mitn Stieber Twins zweimal ins Doppelbett, platonisch, ohne Sex?
Für dich ist Hip Hop nur n' Modegag
Bist doch bloß am Set weil im Projekt Kohle steckt
Ich bin der, der Texte schreibt, mein Bruder der der Noten setzt
Und zwischen Heidelberg und München geben wir zwei Bodenblech
Zuviel Alkohol im Arsch
Klar, schon sitzt man im Idiotentest

      Flint Town
     </title>
     <lyrics>
      what's up
If you from Flint
Get out ya seat
Get up of your ass
Drink your brew and smoke that grass
We fixin to rock from Pontiac to LANSING back to Saginaw to Detroit
And take over in every club
Bootleg, Shoestring,  and the muthafuckin Backstabba
Ehh, we gonna do it like this

I'm sayin what's up to the muthafuckin flintstone thugs
Just drink your brew and smoke that bud
Three off muthafucka's from around the way
If you not from Flint than you get no play
I go to Lucky's, Ditty Boys, and to Charlie C's
I go to skate in CLC cause it's in a mix
I like drinkin at the Vets ????????
TDF is in this bitch cause we da boys from the avenue
Maniac Lunatic and you know that I'm tellin it
Bitch's head in my way, you know that I'm swirlin it
So all you punks take your weak ass to school
Be calm and cool don't be no fool
I'm talkin north and northwestern, and central too
K.C. and Joyce we gonna rock for you
I'm sayin peace to my homies a Whether B
Fred Dogg S P double E D Y cause that's my type of guy
DeWalt Evans and BigJ Ski into the muthafuckin job done by my boy Joe B
Seaten Hall is in the house and Dayton is too
Wesely is down, cause it's in Flint town
So all you Flint muthafuckas listen to what I say
Throw you hands in the air hooray hooray
I'm sayin peace to my brother and my sista too
I'm sayin peace to the Heinkle's and the Dorsey's crew

(chorus)
Where the fuck are you from ffffff Flint town
Where the fuck are they from ffffff Flint town
Where the fuck are you from ffffff Flint town
Where the fuck are they from ffffff Flint town
Where the fuck are you from ffffff Flint town
Where the fuck are they from ffffff Flint town
Where the fuck are you from ffffff Flint town
Where the fuck are they from ffffff Flint town

My name is Ira Dorsey
Let my name be known
I'm the man thats killin bitches
Leaving stitches in nigga's domes
Flint is clossin in on me
But still I'm not friendly
The trama in my life
Through different phases, it sends me
I grew up as a shorty knowin broke wasn't cool
Now I got a workin girl in almost every high school
Pump this in your nissans, beamers, and trucks too
And if your not from Flint then it's like straight up fuck you
The city that I'm from is just a dot on the map
Where dope houses get robbed and most of the clubs ????? (dem shouts)
Michael Jackson said it don't matter black or white but it should
Cause Flint Michigan's a long way from Hollywood
I tried to go to college but I saw myself stuck in Flint
Beside them college folks don't want no po male black resident
Flint Michigan's a prison and we all are locked up
The only good jobs are the jobs that could be rocked up
Refused to work for Burger King and still be livin po
How can you work for Burger King an live in a condo
My city's being fuck by your system, that's evident
Puts bullets in a brother at a club back to ignorent
Special shouts to big boomer, personal autograph
And shouts to all those niggas I forgot down on Dayton Ave
There's one more thing you should know before I go with the sound
Who the fuck is yall to tell ????? (brent) not to leave this town

(chorus)
Where the fuck are you from ffffff Flint town
Where the fuck are they from ffffff Flint town
Where the fuck are you from ffffff Flint town
Where the fuck are they from ffffff Flint town
Where the fuck are you from ffffff Flint town
Where the fuck are they from ffffff Flint town
Where the fuck are you from ffffff Flint town
Where the fuck are they from ffffff Flint town

Flint is dominated
But never immatated
The others perpatrated
But still we regulated
The Dayton Family is a nation
To build a new creation
To take a vacation that is an occupation
Flint ho's is steady sackin
Flint nigga's steady jackin
Them fiend's is stead crackin
Some pimp's is steady mackin
Some homies chasin Jason
Them cops is steady macin
Just because he's basin
Many years this nigga facin

No money so you lootless
No cain so you tootless
No food in your digestive system so your booty pootless
But niggas wearin dickies, but some are bein picky
They see me in my packas and these bitches wanna lick me
Groove to the sounds of the TDF
Takin ova like rova till there's no time left
On stage in a rage
We might get payed
We can tell you where we're from but not our age
From the F to the L to the I-N-T
To the D-A-Y-T-O-N   A-V-E
So just shake your body and don't you quit
Other cities say they're number one, but that's hoeshit

(chorus)
Where the fuck are you from ffffff Flint town
Where the fuck are they from ffffff Flint town
Where the fuck are you from ffffff Flint town
Where the fuck are they from ffffff Flint town
Where the fuck are you from ffffff Flint town
Where the fuck are they from ffffff Flint town
Where the fuck are you from ffffff Flint town
Where the fuck are they from ffffff Flint town

[Verse 1: Ya Boy]
You betta ask around (Chyea!), my niggas packin' pounds
I used to play wit waterguns, now I'm packin' rachets pow (Brraatt!)
We keep +Heat+, you'd think Wade &amp; Shaq in town

They claim to be tha best, and I'm askin' how?
Ya Boy done hooked up wit tha virus, call me Westnile (Chyea!)
Call the sirens, shells flyin', hope your vest around
Shots fiiyyed (Ahhh!), leave em paralized from neck to down (Unh!)
I'm talkin' wreckless now, hit tha booth and wreck it down (Yeah!)
Alwais made stacks, instead of crack I'm sellin' records now (Unhh!)
I eat beef like a double deck of checkers burger
I ain't scared to do a murda, im'a weapon squirta
I'll let tha weapon squirt'cha, wet'cha like a f-in surfa
Aye we keep work, hope ya nerves is good lesson learna (Yuh!)
Two niggas, four burnas like a stove top
Aim tha fif' and leave tha sucka stiff like a blow pop
Cock and dump, pop tha trunk, stuff him like stove top
Rolled around fo' two weeks and got tha Range Rove, Haa!
I'm like Moses how dem O's spark
Make tha coke go hard on tha back of tha bus, like Rosa Parks (Chyea!)
And duck ki's like Mozart
Tha way fo's spark, ya betta be on tha look out like tha coast guard (Yeah!)
Be quiet, we'll shootcha (Brraatt!)
Have ya hooked up to mo' wires then a back of a computa
BITCH!

Non of dat nikka (Bay Area stand up!)
You wann' see me nigga? (Yuh!) Then walk nigga, walk!

[Verse 2: Cyssero]
Chyea!
Movin' thru tha hood wit tha choppa on deck (Deck!)
Pounds of dat skunk burryed down in tha trunk (Trunk!)
Red-fitted, white-T, over tha brim
Highly-intoxicated from tha doja and gin
Ridin' like tha rolla-coasta, holdin' toasta wit him
Hollow-point, two 2-3's, loaded in a min
Somethin' used wit wit tha scope so I can focus it in
Hit his head and dissapear, hocus-pokus wit him (Yeah!)
I'm from tha hood where they give rock to go to tha penn'
Tha grave where a lot of em go, but jail is where most of dem been
It's so damn pathetic, I'm coppin' hammer after hammer
Gotta hammer fetish, beef - I'll let tha hammer get it
If you talkin' - I'm sparkin', him and his mayne a get it (Brraatt!)
A head shot, numb his body like a anastetic
I got, money on my mind and got plans to get it (Chyea!)
Brain stormin' in a 'coupe, smokin' grams of relish
Hardest nigga out, ask - tha fans'll tell ya (Chyea!)
I'm tha shit (Smell It!), even ya gurl can smell it (Hahaha)
I'm mach 5 movin' - I am not human
I'm alreadi been chosen, you can stop choosin'
Yes! I'm tha most cleaverly experienced, line-fo'-line lyricst
Point blank, period!!
Listin when you're hearin' it, mayne im somethin' serius
Full beard, A.K., I move like terrorist
Give you 36 like a square when I'm air-in it
So while you're still breath-in air, you betta cherish it (Chee-Yuh!)
You think you betta then me? I think he hillarious! (Hahaha)
I'ma pittbull off tha leash, capiche? (Yeah!)
Neva broke, I got work I could sell (Uh huh)
And workin' wit dat workin' got me workin' wit skells
Where I'm from, they eitha end up in a hearse or in jail
I spit piff, you could roll this whole verse in a "L"
NIKKA!!!

[Outro]
(Yeah, Nikka!) From Killa-Cali to Killa'delphia (Ya Boy, Cyssero!)
Pussy azz nikkas!! We got tha mothafuckin' body bags readi fo' you bitches,

If you ain't like it, fuck you and ya momma nikka!
Dat's how we get tha fuck down nikka! (Put a make up on dem nikkas, show em

      That's My Car
     </title>
     <lyrics>
      (Verse 1, AK)
Just, bailin' outta the bed
Crossed up with some ho with some nice head
Feelin' exhausted from the slow sex
Still sippin' on the last night's Moet
I'm bout to get dressed
So I pull out the Prada with the Gucci fit
Might as well pull out two fit
At the burger workin' too thick
Lookin' too slick, about to jump off wit' two chicks
On the way to the strip to bump off a new bitch
Got the digits, hit the Hydro too quick, skeet
Me and lil' or whatever in the hood when we campaign
Flamin' mary, bumpin' Champagne, later on get a lil' brain
If the head right, I'm in the Cadillac every night
Tinted windows, like air-tight
And it seem like... ch-oh-ch-ahhhh
Rich niggas, in the bread... ohh-ahhhhh
Bumpin' ho's and the woodgrain
I make 'em say "Who Dat?" (Who dat? Who dat?)
The colored nigga from the Chi, whoever knew that?
A Black n' Mild with some Hennessy, wit' two sacks
Nigga true dat...

(Hook, Johnny P)
And we be ridin' Lacs
Little kids be like...
That's my car! Thats my car!
And we be ridin' Lacs
Little kids be like...
That's my caaar, that's my caaar

And We be ridin' Lacs
Little kids be like...
That's my car! That's my car!
And we be ridin' Lacs
Little kids be like...
That's my caaar, that's my caaar

(Verse 2, Belo)
Well I gotta pimp, like automatically
Cuz I kinda like a bitch, on the canopy
Baby mama lookin' very mad at me
But I choked her with the dick, like magically
And drastically, got a car full of ho's in my Escalade
Six T.V.'s in my Escalade, twenty inch rims on my Escalade
Thanks to babe, you niggas say "ugh, ain't this some shhhh...?"
Dressed in black, Lou Dob hat, spells C-A-D-I, Cadillac
Bumpin' A-C with the ho's in the back
Used to be the clique, see two matter fact
And "Pimpology" keep the women in tact
Gettin' paper when I'm watchin' the Mac
Bet a hundred dollars, did I do that?
Niggas pay a ho, puttin' flaws in the game
And niggas say Belo put a pause to your name?
I'm a bad pimp, beat a ho with a flame
Niggas ain't changed, y'all know the game
I could meditate while a girl gimme brain
Dodgin' the pump when I'm switchin' the lane
"Money ain't a Thang", chicks ain't a thang
Chrys' ain't a thang, hoggin' the lane

(Hook, Johnny P)
And we be ridin' Lacs
Little kids be like...
That's my car! Thats my car!
And we be ridin' Lacs
Little kids be like...
That's my caaar, that's my caaar

And We be ridin' Lacs
Little kids be like...
That's my car! That's my car!
And we be ridin' Lacs
Little kids be like...
That's my caaar, that's my caaar

(Verse 3, N.A.R.D.S)
Yo, when you don't grow up in this game
Ain't know about your walk
Or how many chicks ya got
Or who could ride a colder slab
'Cause we "Still Po Pimpin'"
Puttin' it down wit' the oldest macks
See I was told the fact that
Good game check all game
And y'all could be messin' wit these broads and thangs
Have a nigga bein' Crip, gettin' all at'cha thangs
Be stepped up, but how yall gonna explain?
And uhh... hell nah she can't come for my dough
But why she gon' fight other chicks, I don't know
Some of 'em move befo' they pass through the floor
See I could go pass for a chick to the dope
And uhh....

(Johnny P, singing)
See we don't love these ho's
And we don't trust these ho's
Gotta stay above these ho's
All I know, we just fuck these hooo's

(Verse 3, continued)
That's what a old pimp told me
Never love a chick that be runnin' the streets
Never love a chick that be gone for weeks
Never love a chick that be offerin' your peep's
If she gon' creep, then gon' let her creep
If she gon' cheat, then gon' let her cheat
If she gon' freak, then gon' let her freak
If a ho don't work, then a ho don't eat

(Hook, Johnny P)
And we be ridin' Lacs
Little kids be like...
That's my car! Thats my car!
And we be ridin' Lacs
Little kids be like...
That's my caaar, that's my caaar

And We be ridin' Lacs
Little kids be like...
That's my car! That's my car!
And we be ridin' Lacs
Little kids be like...
That's my caaar, that's my caaar

(Johnny P, singing)
Every time I hit the spot
All the honey's think I'm hot
You know the twenty's don't stop
Every time I'm 'finna plot
I say wassup and blow
Cause all the shorty's know
It's mista....
Whhhhoooooooaaaaaaaa

[N.A.R.D. / Johnny P]
So I'll leave here mama I'll be there, ok
Cadillac (cadillac) pimpin... pimpin (escalade)
Do or Die Ridin through the cold Chi (riding so high)
Back 2 the game yall (were back Belo, AK)
some pimpology (escalade) so obviously we learned there biology
(Do or Die J. P. lets ride)

[N.A.R.D.]
Do you love, money, chasin papers and doin capers
bending the chi and then vegas like you one of the Lakers
steady cuffin that paper, ladys can't fake us, so I stay cautious regardless
like a million dollars keep sparkin better yet its that V.I.P barkin
(niggaz aint ready to die)
Cause please, that be me sparkin sharp and bendin calm in that lac
bendin hard with ladys slobbin and bobbin
aww man I been on that chick since back in college
see, she like them top notch with the glock cocked
put the money and glock block them CEO's who invest in stock plots
substance blowin out the sunroof with your drop top
smokin on that chop flop ladys call me pa pa and groupies call me na na
so cha cha like legit do whatever suits that fit you
if paper be your issue, then you be your issue
but this paper make that paper, and this paper make that paper,
this paper make that paper so you stay away from haters

[Chorus, Johnny P]
we ride diamonds in the back, sunroof top,
diggin in the scene with a gangster lean ohhhohhhhhh.. ohhoohhhh
we ride diamonds in the back, sunroof top,
diggin in the scene with a pimp lean ohhohhhh my my can you smoke and ride

[AK 47]
You can see it in my eyes when I'm hustlin, burnt up tryin to come up from
nothing
I be stackin them stacks bringin em back in the back of the lac
talkin in codes to the burn outs hustlin daily got me turned out
you know my motto to invest and chase that paper like lotto
follow, tryin to bring back money in car loads
but its hard to listen when you tryin to get that platinum benzy
or purchase a home for my belo luxury home with a platinum visa
its hard to imagine something like a nigga tryin to catch an orgasm
track that feeling like a spasm
tryin to study passin, got a passion gotta count that cheese
they off in the breeze but it aint nothing
if you got that paper then say something
better put it away Cause the day comin when you fall off,
when you just wanna hall off with four sawed offs blow it all off
recognise its the big faces that count, better yet better stay flexed
check the paper stay stressed and get all the dough whether its fast or slow
get up to the point where the cash will flow
Burger King and Mcdonalds really aint the way the best will go
and its so cold in these windy streets
when the ends meet your life will be ends deep with white shit

[Chorus]

[Belo Zero]
this is my motto, pop the first bottle
louie call 1 3 grab the key then follow
ride up to my home paid for mansion celebrating you ladys on tables dance on
M O N E Y got to have it me I remember hustlin when I was a shorty
now or a forty X5 5 of those sit back relax and private show
no how it go more money more problem well the problem is you solve it
don't let the money become you you take it and revolve it
no matter how you get it you hustle and go get it square stick with it
make sure all the numbers split Cause all of them done did it
the Rockafellers Stellers and Jones
to many other people got paper but we homeless
and let alone this, we chillin while we swervin bumpin 92.3 in the suburban
hittin curbs in city fresh yall Proda to the feet bonapetite
no second guess yall we confess yall love the curency don't you playa hate
love the game you can't worry me, you can't worry me

[Chorus]

[N.A.R.D.]
J P, J P
everybody may not have a great big Cadillac
gangsta white walls, TV's and antennas in the back (uh uh)
some peoples may not have a car at all
but they got to remember brothers and sisters (remember)
we still can pimp talk, rotate them gangster white walls
never givin a dime to a broad (no no never)
and we gone keep on pimpin baby (keep pimpin)
we gone keep on pimpin baby (for real)
untill somebody turn the lights out, so J. P. come on bring us home

[Johnny P]
yeah, wohhhhohhhohhhh wohhhohhhh
I just wanna feel, Cause you may not have a gravy kind of life
diamonds in the back, sunroof top, diggin in the scene with a gangster lean
you may night driiivvveee no car at all, ohh myyy
but you can still stand tall, still stand tall... hooo
Cause I'm ridin in my escalade
ridin
ridin

[Chorus: Brotha Lynch Hung]
That motherfucker kept sniffin for goods
Put the plastic in his mouth the back of his neck left
And you don't know nuthin but the killa gotta away
Before 4.30 in the morning I'm gone in the 6-Tre
Wit the windows up, must have had gin in the cup
Cuz I'm swervin in the fast-lane gotta be spinnin em up
(X-caliba *echo*)

[Verse 1: Brotha Lynch Hung]
It all started when I twisted the lid of the Olde E
And see E-A-R-double-O-E... ... ... (??)
Where my motherfuckering siccmade jacked at
Cuz that's the only one I could use
When I saw you at the war yeah when I lifted you out your shoes
It was the pressure from the twenty game (the twenty game)
Felt like it could split your chest whide open wit it
Well nigga you should when I'm round talkin that shit
Bout the nigga that's my kin-folks
Should knew the wheel while you was givin up that info...
...mation, I'll be of that Parry Mason
When I hit em all up, creep em all up, kill em all up, fill em all up
Real deal, dig a ditch give em hit a licc then take the grip
Put em in the back of the Cadillac show em how my Mini-Mac gonna act
My tactics is lethal
Leave the whole town hella smokey
like that band that steppin over dead people
It's like that, and you wouldn't know it cuz I'ma cool ass mufucca
Then dump on a gang of succas
as I wait for the city to heat up like a Hot Pepper
Gotta whole load fulla Evian
and a trunck fulla FO take no's and I can't let go
Catch you at yo show slippin
Hoes trippin, rows rippin in the street after I heat my heat of
I'm of the hook with this siccmade shit, straight made nigga
Fuck it, pass me the straight lace liquor to the face nigga
Off the Thunder Burger and Kool-Aid and O 8
Easy on the liver still make me kill a nigga
Split you head like a pineapple
Die natural!
Five at your dome send em home in a pinebox
Lift you out your sox
Pay attention to the Glock
Half pass a niggas ass where aimen at the grass take suitcase fulla cash and mash
16 in the clip crumble the urb roll a sliff bout to whatch you brain split in half
Bloody bath watter, infried nigga nuts and bones locaded at home I think him name is Tyrone
But you know...

[Chorus: Brotha Lynch Hung]
That motherfucker kept sniffin for goods
Put the plastic in his mouth the back of his neck left
And you don't know nuthin but the killa gotta away
Before 4.30 in the morning I'm gone in the 6-Tre
Wit the windows up, must have had gin in the cup
Cuz I'm swervin in the fast-lane gotta be spinnin em up
(X-caliba *echo*)

[Verse 2: Brotha Lynch Hung]
You can call me black Sadam Huseain
Pump St Idees through my wein ass nigga
You can see me on the southside of the street
Man remembered by the ((opposet)) nigga that flod the city
Get ready for some pretty if you sicc like Frank Nitty
Sucked blood from my momas tittie - instead of milk
Played murda muzicc in my tape deck - instead of Silkk
Enden up killen one of them motherfuckers
So fuck them hoes, they like Grim
havin killin niggas like they gots to go
With the 380M - got high til seven
Jump in what you call it headin throughwards heaven, whit my
50 sacc of some shit, that'll make you get there
About 11:30 with your T-shirt dirty,
I'm worthy strapped like James as ventured in this faulty game
In a mainframe, that I bucked in ruff terrain, then hit the plane
15 guts on a tripple beam scale nigga
acual contact from the strap that I hale nigga

[Chorus: Brotha Lynch Hung]
That motherfucker kept sniffin for goods
Put the plastic in his mouth the back of his neck left
And you don't know nuthin but the killa gotta away
Before 4.30 in the morning I'm gone in the 6-Tre
Wit the windows up, must have had gin in the cup
Cuz I'm swervin in the fast-lane gotta be spinnin em up
(X-caliba *echo*)

[Verse 3: Brotha Lynch Hung]
They got this motherfucker twisted up
And from the sound of the barrle I got hella motherfuckers runnin up
What should I do about these fuckin fleas?
Give em all A-1 and put they seeds in they weed
Figga a way out this nigga I know you got me in file
But I got you on scanner so plan anotha way (anotha way)
Told me it was (?Coda steady?)
But I catch you slippin like pimpin
and shake bankin like (?Trail Leonard?)
Hit your mind workin these swine
tripp time get's deepa as you meat the Grim reapa
in the form of a man double M 24 5 got your brains leaking I'm peakin
That's why these nigga wanna rip keep me
I'm rollin squeeky and what you want call it
witta .45 in my pocket and I'm a young alcoholic
Like P-Folks I had to make it happen
Sacramentos most wanted I gotta keep packin, cuz of that
My favorite cousin just go four years
And when his little brotha died he showed me no tears
your point is you get deep as the ocean
Take a shiesty niggas blood and rub it on like lotion
It was like: once apon a time a long time ago
I was sticken 9 milis in a pussy hole
Get of the Ol 8 old Murda moe then i gotta go to a spot
when they don't know I'm the leath nigga given up my info

[Chorus: Brotha Lynch Hung]
That motherfucker kept sniffin for goods
Put the plastic in his mouth the back of his neck left
And you don't know nuthin but the killa gotta away
Before 4.30 in the morning I'm gone in the 6-Tre
Wit the windows up, must have had gin in the cup
Cuz I'm swervin in the fast-lane gotta be spinnin em up
(X-caliba *echo*)

      Just Swingin'
     </title>
     <lyrics>
      INTRO [Maestro Fresh Wes] {Ebony MC}
Ahh yes
Swinging along, just swinging ahh yeah
Me and my main man Ebony MC {Right about now}
Just swinging along {We just swinging along}
Ah yeah, special shout out {Bust it}

[Maestro Fresh Wes] {Ebony MC} (Both)
We rock the mic {We rock the mic well}
We rock the mic {We rock the mic}
Well, we rock the mic and (We rock the mic well)
(1) for the treble (2) for the bass
Come on Ebony MC help me rock the place

{Ebony MC}
We be waiting, playing, anticipation
The next new rhyme that I be creating
For '89 I decided to fix, my rhymes
To make them fresher, to cook under pressure
To be on top and never be the lesser
I'm the animal, uh the hunter
To go getter of a guy
I am the best of the west the beast of the east
Some people call me lazy, but that's alright
I like to lie around talk around, fun around
Sleep, get comfortable and even relax
'Til my sleep meter reaches the ultimate max
To live without my waterbed would be ?????
'Til the party roles around my...
[Maestro]
Well, I'll never be a peddler, never be a bagger
I'm not Jimmy Walker, but I'm not a Swarteneger
You know I got the build of a regular man
I'm not a J.J., but not no Conan
Just Maestro, not second or third
I eat at Burger King 'cause I'm not Herb
And if your name happens to be Herb
Just say {I'm not the Herb you're looking for, Word}
I hate to meet mothers, hat e to meet fathers
They all want me to marry their daughters
It happens to me almost everyday
A girl will take me to her crib and this is what she'll say
'Mom and dad this is Wes' and I'll say hi
Ma will pinch me on the cheek like I'm mom's apple pie
Dad says 'I'm pleased to meet you, I'm Mr. Jones'
'You the most decent chap Janine's brought home'
'Would you like to have a beer?'
No thanks just juice
'Grandma woke up, we'll have to introduce'
'Oh, by the way call me pa, we love to make you our son-in-law'
See what I mean they won't leave me alone
I just wanted to jump in Janine's pretty little bones
Janine said 'grandma, this is Wes'
Grammy said 'hi' I guess she was deaf
I said, hi my name is Wes, 'did you say Fresh?'
That's right Fresh Wes, I drank the juice and I left
{Ebony MC}
Well I was walking downtown and I saw this whore
She had a body like a two by four
She came on over, asked for my number
I said, no ho, all you want is my lumber
No, no baby I won't be doing that
You won't see me stroking no street corner cat
'Cause I'm an arcade junkie, my rhymes are funky
My beats and rhymes rocked Humpty Dumpty
MCs want to thump me, girls want to jump me
My face is smooth and never ever lumpy
(*Laughter*)
[M] That was good, that was good
{E} Yo, Wes drop that Snow White story man
Go ahead, drop it

[Maestro]
Check it out
I remember a story, when I was small
About Snow White and the seven Dwarves
Well, if you ask me, I know that couldn't be true
If I was one of them I knew exactly what I'd do {What, what?}
The story that was told was totally wack
Snow White was a freak and the dwarves were black
She lived in a house, you could probably figure
What she be doing with a bunch of horny niggas
Doc, Dopey, Grumpy, Sneezy
Come one, come on, come on she was sleazy
Happy, Sleepy and my brother Bashful
Made sure Snow White got her mouthful
{Ebony MC}
Well I'm the cutest looking guy, I like to say
Conceded you call me, but that's okay
I've often thought about posing for ceterfolds
The girl designed me and they broke the mold
Part of the creation, what can I say
They even made up an Ebony playmate
You know I always keep the body looking fine
The dimple, the smile, nothing out of line
No dirt in the dimples, I keep the face neat
No sugar in the body, I eat the Shredded Wheat
I use the eye drops to keep the eyes clean
Hair so fine I use Ultra-sheen
The buttock firm, the girls enjoy that
No need for exercise I don't collect fat
The feet are large and the jewels look great
You could try to change but you're late get laid
Wish you were me but that could never be
First of all your name is not Ebony MC
[Maestro]
Well, I'm not too big, not too small {Average}
Not too short, but I'm not that tall {5'9" 5'10"}
I'm not a heavy guy and my head ain't bald
As I drive the girls up the wall
I had a girl and her name was Judy
Judy had a super dope big fat booty {Big fat booty}
Everything was cool and everything was okay
Until I met this freak named Shebon {Shebon} the other day
Shebon had a shape like an hourglass
Real fine legs with ... {let's just pass}
Although she looked young, she was an older girl
Thick like Judy with Malaysian curl
Judy had night school onec a week
So that would be the night I'd rock that freak
Well that night I went over to Shebon's place
And to the bedroom we quickly laid
Then I rocked her, oh my, and took a rest
I saw a picture of a child on her bedroom chest {Easy}
I took a good look and I felt so bad
'Cause it was a portrait of Judy at her Grade 8 grad
Torn between two lovers {It's okay Wes, It's okay}
Feeling like a fool {Don't cry man}
I just fucked Judy's mother, and Judy's in night school
Like Keith I make the ladies Sweat
What yo learn about women, I'm trying to forget
I wrote a love jam, now the girls are drooling
I play like Heavy D boy, (just coolin')
Like Laverte, I'm the love expert
No time for casanova but I clock 'nuff skirts
To be blousing, my rhyme arouses
Like blue violets and red rouses
{We rock the mic} we rock the mic {Well}
{We rock the mic} we rock the mic {Well}
{We rock the mic} we rock the mic {Well}
We rock the mic and {We rock the mic well}

      Hit and Run
     </title>
     <lyrics>
      [J-Ro]
I pull up to front with a smash to the ground black duly
Niggaz in the street gettin wild and unruly
Digga B was in the front so he let me through the door
I never get frisked so I pack a forty-four
Straight to the bar, can I get a rum and coke?
The whole club was filled with the indo smoke
E-Swift was scratchin, Tash was hoe catchin
I had the latest fashion but my shit wasn't matchin
So King Tee was baggin, the nigga Threat was braggin
Bout his brand new, baby boo, fiendin with the rag in
Lorenzo's, but anyway, them hoes was deep
Peep, E-Swift shoe em how we creep

[E-Swift]
Check you out, yeah you baby, up against the wall
Here's a dollar ten rum and coke, heavy on the alcohol
Starin at your chest, and I can only guess
Lord have mercy what's up under that Adidas dress
Yo shortay, you're lookin kinda nice
Stick around and watch us rock the mic device
She gave me this look like she was puzzled or troubled
I don't think I'm large so she didn't bust my bubble
It's the Liks baby where your girlfriends at
She said they got thrown out tryin to sneak in the back
No sweat, I'll go out and get em
Hooked it up for Noid and Tash to get with em
Now we on stage stop the mic from back-feedin
Got the three hoes in the front row chillin
That's how it be when you play high post
Cause all I wanna do is tap that ass and get ghost

[Xzibit]
This is how I roll it, I met her at a club last week
It was this fly ass freak, I didn't sleep, I got the digits, laid back
Coolin at the crib one day
I think I'll call her, we're talkin on thephone for half an hour
I finally ask her can a nigga come through
She talkin bout she ain't dressed I said "Cool, I'm still comin over"
I get there, she's chillin in some undies and a robe
Ice cold, forty down in the freezer
And roll up blunts at my leisure, I play like I believe her
How she tellin me she ain't no skeezer
An hour later I was breakin her off
in each and every position that you can ever put a bitch in
I got up and then I washed my shit
Alright bitch, word got her rings then I split
Yeah back to the shade, so I can get my lounge in effect
Xzibit keep the hoes in check, so check

Chorus: Repeat 2X

All I really wanna do
Is tap that ass 'fore the night is through
All I really wanna do
Is tap that ass and get ghost with the cash

[J-Ro]
I was drunk as hell-est, I begin to bill for my pray
the club reminded me of whylin at the Bush back in the day
That's when I seen her, the freak from the diner
Her name was Nina, or Tina, or was it Regina
Fuck it, the bitch with the tipple bitties and the boomin bass
I said my name is big game all in her face
I said for what it's worth, I'm the best on earth
Kickin folls off my turf since the day of my birth
I got a pocket full of money do you wanna help me spend it
Can I get in your backfield like Cornelius Bennet
She said, "Mmm, J-Ro yeah!
Just let me know the time and I'll be there"
I said, "I'm drunk, tired, hoe, for heaven's sake
Let's go to Larry Parker's for a burger and a shake"
We got to the place I started stuffin my face
Not a bid did I waste, cause it was good to the taste
I didn't wanna get stuck so I said, "What the heck
I left my money in the truck so won't you pick up the check"
And the next move, you might think it's tasteless
But I gave her a tip and got ghost with the waitress

[Xzibit]
We rip shows, and hoes drop clothes backstage it's funny
The shit bitches do for money
Only jockin on a nigga with his name in lights
I'd rather kickback relax and play the shades real tight
Yo last time, caught it with this fresh-ass hooker
Kept runnin her mouth about what it last meant to her
I said, "Look hon, all I gots is blunts, forties
A couple of brothers cause I don't know the kids before me
You're trippin."  Dip into the streets to chill
Nigga these days, I'm gettin PJ's, on the freeways
It's lovely, I get home, blaze up another drink
of somethin kinda stronger, to make the funk last longer
Yo, it's the one and only who welp the bitches
Thinkin they got me but yo they gettin they-self
I'm a bomb like the stealth, and hit way up above your wealth
You felt the vibe when I tapped that ass

      (Grind, Music)

[Intro: Ghostface]
Aiyyo, where the fuck is that blunt at?
Where y'all niggaz hoggin the shit man?
Two pulls of that shit nigga start gettin paranoid and shh
Get your fuckin, get your feet off my fuckin table nigga!
Fuck you think you at home, with your cheap fur on?
Shit look like it 'bout to bite somethin and shit nigga

[Ghostface Killah]
Yo, yo, it was the night before he got popped
Big jars of haze, Cheech &amp; Chong bong in the spot
Tropicana, strawberries, diced bananas
The long dookie fifth, next to the Town House crackers
Mad noise, 2008, a G a game
I'm Ron O'Neal in the love seat, sunk deep
Long niggaz bustin out they punk heat
I make a massacre, try to rob one of my donkeys
But I ain't wettin that
I don't wanna send nobody back, violate me, take a nap
Promise you, got somethin Lord that'll honor you
Blow your little head off while you're tyin your shoe
But back in the kitchen, Pyrex's
Occupied by the twins, bank robbers with large records
Hard vest-es, '86 got guards on
Benatar ruggies and frames and fake guns when they robbed Sha Born
To them that's natural, actual
Play the squid-ad, we gettin at you
And we don't wanna rap to you, it's not kosher
It's not a code in la costa nostra to roast ya
I get a lil' closer
Rock you to sleep, like I got these lil' bitches, come over!
Hopin you fall for the bait, thinkin you safe
Have that ass sweatin like T.D. Jakes
I want the ones nigga, you non-believers you can ask your momma
... Now that's drama

[Joell Ortiz]
Uhh, dollar icey from, papi with the scraper, glock with the laser
Tryin my best not to pop yet but the drop is major
Shot my lil' cuz, I do my aunt a favor, watch this
I never been this itchy, hope these cops just
get a doughnut urge and just splurge, you got the nerve to play third?
In a softball tournament round my way, say that's ya word
You bird, I'll put your beak on the curb but anyway
Looks like a good game, the pigs ain't leavin so I'ma lay
Nice play, just too bad it's your last
Couple bundles of D, and 200 cash that sat you in the grass
I watch the teams line up, shake hands, guess the game's over
Faggot nigga hopped in the Liberty, fake Range Rover
I'm on his +Tail+ like, Sonic lil' shorty
Palmin on a 40, broad day I'm tryin to dodge a cover story
Look like he stoppin for gas, I'ma pluck 'em, yay
This had to be his most, unlucky lucky day
Two brothers come out 7/11 in Army wear and stand there
I'm actin like my tires need air
He close the gas cap, too many things goin his way
So I just stashed that, y'all probably think I'm buggin but hey
I know them games in Lindsay Park is every Sunday, he ain't goin nowhere
I went home, switch gear, went out and grabbed me a beer
Ten drinks later I'm at Burger King window for a Whopper
Look left and see partner, I hit the stash BLAKA!
... Now that's drama

[The Game]
Who the fuck you think you is, Ron O'Neal?
Tat-tat, what the fuck when that 9-milli peel
(Is it real?) Realer than Pittsburg +Steel+
Yo Ghost pass the toast, these niggaz is daffodils
Got butt-naked bitches countin half a mil', gloves on
Fully dressed bitches watchin them, with they snubs on
While I'm in the kitchen pretendin to be Raekwon
Watchin Rachael Ray all day, I get my cake on
Fiends love me like a Drake song
Rep that Lou' Vuitton Bottom in my back pocket all day long
Black Wall Mafia, Wu-Tang Sopranos
Niggaz say they pushin ki's/keys but we don't see pianos
Niggaz say they pushin Phantoms, we don't see the +Opera+
Niggaz steady rockin dreads, you ain't even rasta
Take your New Era off, and reveal
the faggot nigga you are or your +cap+ gettin peeled
Then we out to Brazil, I know niggaz in Negril
that'll chop your fuckin head off, and throw it on the grill
Take the gold out your mouth and throw it in they grill
Send a finger to your moms and let her know that it's real
Nigga we in the field like Chris Johnson
It's 2010, how the fuck we get six Thompsons?
Top 10, how the fuck you gon' forget Compton?
Every rapper on your list'll get they shit stomped in
I started Su-Wu, I'm the reason for that 5 shit
Came in the game, on that fuckin "Ready to Die" shit
Sold 9 mil', ended up on some fly shit
Naked pictures, R&amp;B bitches all in my Sidekick
How I be killin the pussy, should be a hate crime
Got a Blackberry, was gettin too much face time
Back to fuckin project bitches, now I hate dimes
All they want is money my nigga, I can't waste mine
I son/sun niggaz like it's daytime
Gray cotton Louis sweatsuit, with the Ralph Lauren waistline
Smooth as a baby's ass, and I got that Baby cash
Catch me in the hood, same deals Old Navy had
Motherfuckers

      Shoot Your Shot
     </title>
     <lyrics>
      [Andy Cooper]
Here we go!

[Chorus]
SHOOT YOUR SHOT!
Man, I wanna know WHAT YOU GOT!
Load it up and HIT THAT SPOT!
Grab the mic and SHOOT YOUR SHOT!

[Andy Cooper]
Thes One!

[Thes One]
Hey yo, P-U-T-S and U-D, you be truly blessed
Rap panelist, Thes handle this like an analyst
(YES!) yes y'all the Einstein rhythm and rhyme
Combines like red wine and Tylenol
(OOOOH!) Shit, the grown relaxing in the field
But don't sleep, P count green, not sheep
With K. Jax, he rolls up the weed like haystacks
To bath tub down on you scrubs like Ajax
You're too fruity to rip the rooty tooty with your loofah
New booty ladies too lazy to raise the roof up
The plug desenchufa, could the crew get any doper
Man, we own this, live under the stairs like Mr. Roper
Home of the (NEW) generation, we got the torch
Let me call into U-D Dustin to bust 'em off
Blown Celeb and resurrecting the dead with three day block
Posse cut resurrection instead, so pass the ROCK!

[Dizzy Dustin]
I'm about to pop the clip in as I stop the opposition
You gotta cop a listen when I'm knockin like a piston
I spit arsenic so I'm hard to miss
You're in a DAZE cause I BLAZE like an arsonist
I come up in the house like a thief in the night
And electrify a crowd like keys on a kite
(STAY CALM!) Before I drop the napalm
Find yourself caught in a dangerous liaison
Lay it on thick, brick by brick, lickety split
Rhymes are fat like Jiminy Glick
You want beef, here's a hickory stick, I shoot the gift
You won't know it till it's over like a mystery flick
To put it blunt, I pack a punch like a school lunch
Got no time for punks, they take lumps
So PLEASE stop bugging for my honeycombs
or I'll hit you in the funny bone (OWW!!)

[Chorus]
SHOOT YOUR SHOT!
Man, I wanna know WHAT YOU GOT!
Load it up and HIT THAT SPOT!
Grab the mic and SHOOT YOUR SHOT!
Come on, you gotta SHOOT YOUR SHOT! (Yeah, yeah)
We wanna know WHAT YOU GOT! (Yeah, yeah)
Load it up and HIT THAT SPOT! (Yeah, yeah)
Grab your mic and SHOOT YOUR SHOT!

[Andy Cooper]
I will!
Andy's the name, takin aim like Calamity Jane
In a rap's last stand I'm the man who remains
When I claim to pack heat (uh-huh), know my ammunition
Is my flow and rhythm SO I'm armed to the teeth
My lungs are gun powder, throat cold and narrow
So when I open my mouth you're looking down the barrel
Of an emcee sniper, eye in the scope
Reigning down rounds of rhyme, fire, and smoke (BOOM!)
Lighting strikes twice from my mic device
Cause when I write it's like guns in knife fights
There's no competition so I don't listen
You think you're dope here's a penny, go wishin
I shoot to kill, better know the odds
Or wind up on boot hill, man get out of dodge
(U-D!) plus Thes One and Double K
We all just laugh when your record is played

[Double K]
Ain't nothing funny, what y'all laughin at?
Yeah, it's K. Jackson over here with my homeboy
You know what I'm saying
I'm just helpin 'em out on this microphone

It goes hippa to the hoppa and it just don't stoppa
I'm dressed in all black with my man K. Jax
I got thrown in the slammer, I tried to battle Hammer
They wanna interview me so I spit in the camera
You know I love Pac, that's why I got SHOT
Had to gain some credibility, now everybody feelin me
I'm on VH-ONE and MTV
I'm down with DJ EZ Rock and I'm back with U-D
It takes one to roll the blunt, it takes two to get jumped
And I be hanging at the church house looking for sluts
I hate rap music but, see, I'm so damn good
My homey told me "Boy, get it like I know that you could"
So I stole the microphone, wrote rhymes on my own
When I go to Burger King all the chicks are on my bone
It grows and grows and grows, gets a little bigger
You wanna see me skeet, baby girl, pull the trigger
I've got bang for your butt and I hate posse cuts
I'm a one mic thriller, I'm a soft beverage chiller
Whoever takes the mic, you better be illa
Now what's the time, everybody say (MILLER!!!!)

[Chorus]
SHOOT YOUR SHOT!
Man, I wanna know WHAT YOU GOT!
Load it up and HIT THAT SPOT!
Grab the mic and SHOOT YOUR SHOT!
Once again, you gotta SHOOT YOUR SHOT! (Yeah, yeah)
I wanna know WHAT YOU GOT! (Yeah, yeah)
Load it up and HIT THAT SPOT! (Yeah, yeah)
Get on the cut and SHOOT YOUR SHOT!

[Andy Cooper]
Einstein!
("I'm a sure shot shooter!") - - &gt; Afrika Baby Sham
Uh-huh, uh-huh
("And my ? got a six shooter loaded with rhymes")
("I'm a sure shot shooter!")  - - &gt; Afrika Baby Sham
Say - WHAT
("And my ? got a six shooter loaded with rhymes")
("I'm a sure shot shooter!")  - - &gt; Afrika Baby Sham
Make it funky, now
("And my ? got a six shooter loaded with rhymes")
("I'm - I'm - I'm - I'm - I'm - I'm a sure shot shooter!")  - - &gt; Afrika Baby Sham
Uh-huh
("Bring it for the right second, then I'm going for mine.")
SHOOT YOUR SHOT! *BANG*

      [Kane *singing*]
Do you know, what you're goin through?
Do you like this style of rap that I'm showin you?
The way I flow for you.. do you know?

[Kane *rapping*]
Yeah baby c'mon
Ah baby baby c'mon, check the rhyme to the song
Uhh, aw yeah baby c'mon
Ah baby baby c'mon, and check the rhyme to the song
One double nine to the four, gotta keep em on the floor
and put some real lyrics back in the hardcore
What I'm used to hearin, I can't believe it's gone
But now just like a grill inside Burger King, the beef is on
When I come, rappers begin to speak in degrees
I even make Sisters With Voices _Weak in the Knees_
So run for your lives, Kane with the pen
is like Freddy with the glove full of knives
Who wanna test these skills, come see how it feels
I pull you one verse, if that don't kill I got refills
You can't do me none, kid you gets nothin
If my rhymes was in braille, you still couldn't touch em
Man, I'm a bad cat, my style of rap is mad fat
And you know, sometimes it's so sad that
Rappers today be comin as the gangster rhyme type
And be so soft, they wouldn't even kill time right
Here's the news, you lettin the word hardcore be misused
You ain't never paid dues
Be for real, you ain't tough yet
The razor bumps on your throat is the only thing makin you a ruffneck
Your whole image is a dammmmmmmmn sham
I'm glad in this business I didn't forget who I am
I always remain the Kane inside a battle
*singing* Never to walk in anyone's shadow
I do my own thing, I do a thing of my own
And with my competition I let it be known
that battles I don't lose none, boy you get bruised son
Six million ways to die -- choose one!
My rap style is like a poisonous vemon
We might as well be havin sex, the way that I put it in em
And do I crush MC's - are you kiddin me?
If rappers were grapes, I'd have a whole wine distillery
So, I bring it to your face, with the bass, then I BLOW
a rapper off the map, with the rap, when I FLOW
then hit you with the skill that is ill, and I KNOW
that all of this is good to go, cause yo
that's the way the flavor always come
The rhymes they flow accordin to the drum
The Brooklyn style caue that is where I'm from
You want the funk so let me give you some
I flip on the flow on the track, just like that
Amazin the people the style of the rapppin, is quite fat
I'm lickin the lyrics and shootin the gat, on the mic black
And this is for all of the rappers that like, and they bite that
The Smooth Operator is mellow with the saxophone
Settin the tone that make the girls relax and moan
Cause all the ladies I'm givin em lots of love
Hittin more skins than a boxing glove, good God
The girls treat me like the drummer and give me some
From tall to short to thick, even the slimmie ones
Watch out Goldie!  Gimme a forty ounce of Olde E
and none of you players can control me
You get the chance to see a true mack man
with skills to pay the bills, to make more stacks than
taller than anybody else's stacks it seem
Cause the Kane get more paper than a fax machine
The unforgettable, rhymes are too poetical
Keep rappers in order more than letters put alphabetical
And I hope the record consumers don't believe the magazine rumors
Cause Kane is makin a comeback, like Puma's!
I get rough G, and set it on your whole damn company
and Bogart, like my name was Humphrey
When I get through, there'll be no more of them
As many rappers I burnt, I should open a crematorium
I make mad MC's give me my P's
If you try to disrespect, kid you can get these
N-U-T's, like the U-N-V's
I leave you down on your knees, down on your knee-heeees!
Razor sharp, many ways of art
Source rings the chart, people praise the God
for kickin the flows so fantasitic and this one here
We're callin it Lyrical Gymnastics

Uhh, so baby baby c'mon
Aw yeah baby c'mon, and check the rhymes to the song
Uhh, ah baby baby c'mon
Suki suki c'mon, and I'm gone!

That nah'jae...(x4)

[Verse 1: Kemo]
Can't remember bein this big, know what I mean love
You can see the dick grin, through my jeans
Fuck Superman and Clark Kent, I'm a machine gun
Every time a nigga cut, they get ya teens up
Every time I'm in the club, you shake that thing for
Me and all the homies girl, I'm like a fiend for
The way you bounce it all around, and shake it real fast
Then you drop it to the ground, you got a fat ol' ass
Baby go both ways, she like dyke and black
Stick the pussy in her face, she be likin that
Stick ya pipe in that, she got the tightest cat
Nigga that's why I keep on comin back, it's like it's crack
Why you tryin to front and shit? now take ya ass home
And run up in your stomach trick, and break the backbone
Put the Profolac on, now tuck ya ass on
"Ahhh I'm coming!", now take ya ass home

[Hook 1: Kaos]
Girl now you know you wanna fuck so what's up

Make sure you wash the fuckin prada lil' bitch
And you wanna do the hump raw, and pump

Girl I wanna see you take in, then
Beat it against ya chin, kiss it just like your girlfriend
Cuz I loves it when you let me sip the tip down on that bottom
Lickin lip, you mix it and then you swallow then you spit
Right down the middle of this dick, you blow out
Curl my toes and smear it that lipstick, shit
My dick ain't grows to be a yard or so
Now keep suckin, keep stuffin
And get it harder yo, and get keep cuffin these nuts

Becomes swollen

      The Real Slim Shady
     </title>
     <lyrics>
      [Eminem]
May I have your attention please?
May I have your attention please?
Will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
I repeat, will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
We're gonna have a problem here..

Y'all act like you never seen a white person before
Jaws all on the floor like Pam, like Tommy just burst in the door
and started whoopin her ass worse than before
they first were divorce, throwin her over furniture (Ahh!)
It's the return of the... "Ah, wait, no way, you're kidding,
he didn't just say what I think he did, did he?"
And Dr. Dre said... nothing you idiots!
Dr. Dre's dead, he's locked in my basement! (Ha-ha!)
Feminist women love Eminem {*vocal turntable:
chigga chigga chigga*} "Slim Shady, I'm sick of him
Look at him, walkin around grabbin his you-know-what
Flippin the you-know-who,"  "Yeah, but he's so cute though!"
Yeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose
But no worse, than what's goin on in your parents' bedrooms
Sometimes, I wanna get on TV and just let loose, but can't
but it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose
"My bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips"
And if I'm lucky, you might just give it a little kiss
And that's the message that we deliver to little kids
And expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is
Of course they gonna know what intercourse is
By the time they hit fourth grade
They got the Discovery Channel don't they?
"We ain't nothing but mammals.." Well, some of us cannibals
who cut other people open like cantaloupes {*SLURP*}
But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes
then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope
{*EWWW!*} But if you feel like I feel, I got the antidote
Women wave your pantyhose, sing the chorus and it goes

Chorus: Eminem (repeat 2X)

I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up,
please stand up, please stand up?

[Eminem]
Will Smith don't gotta cuss in his raps to sell his records;
well I do, so fuck him and fuck you too!
You think I give a damn about a Grammy?
Half of you critics can't even stomach me, let alone stand me
"But Slim, what if you win, wouldn't it be weird?"
Why?  So you guys could just lie to get me here?
So you can, sit me here next to Britney Spears?
Shit, Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs
so I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst
and hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first
You little bitch, put me on blast on MTV
"Yeah, he's cute, but I think he's married to Kim, hee-hee!"
I should download her audio on MP3
and show the whole world how you gave Eminem VD {*AHHH!*}
I'm sick of you little girl and boy groups, all you do is annoy me
so I have been sent here to destroy you {*bzzzt*}
And there's a million of us just like me
who cuss like me; who just don't give a fuck like me
who dress like me; walk, talk and act like me
and just might be the next best thing but not quite me!

Chorus

[Eminem]
I'm like a head trip to listen to, cause I'm only givin you
things you joke about with your friends inside your living room
The only difference is I got the balls to say it
in front of y'all and I don't gotta be false or sugarcoated at all
I just get on the mic and spit it
and whether you like to admit it {*ERR*} I just shit it
better than ninety percent of you rappers out can
Then you wonder how can kids eat up these albums like valiums
It's funny; cause at the rate I'm goin when I'm thirty
I'll be the only person in the nursin home flirting
Pinchin nurses asses when I'm jackin off with Jergens
And I'm jerkin but this whole bag of Viagra isn't working
And every single person is a Slim Shady lurkin
He could be workin at Burger King, spittin on your onion rings
{*HACH*} Or in the parkin lot, circling
Screaming "I don't give a fuck!"
with his windows down and his system up
So, will the real Shady please stand up?
And put one of those fingers on each hand up?
And be proud to be outta your mind and outta control
and one more time, loud as you can, how does it go?

Chorus 2X

[Eminem]
Ha ha
Guess there's a Slim Shady in all of us
Fuck it, let's all stand up

      One Two Shit
     </title>
     <lyrics>
      Intro: Q-Tip, Phife Dawg, Busta Rhymes

One two, one two
One-wa-wa-one, one two one two (3X)
Yo it's the Q-Tip, you know I get down
Yes I rock to the rhythm of a funky sound
It go
One-wa-wa-one, one two one two (2X)

And it's the, Phife Dawg, and I do the same
And when it comes to rippin mics aiyyo it ain't no games
One-wa-wa-one, one two one two (2X)

Aiyyo you know it's Busta Rhymes, ev-ery time
Oh yes, I'm comin wicked with the new design
I'm sayin
One-wa-wa-one, one two one two (2X)

Verse One: Q-Tip

MC's ain't coming equipped with the rhymes
Don't do the crime if you can't do the time
The time is eternal when you play with the miser
Soul is in my body, and the health make me wiser
The tantalizing wordplay yeah that's the joint
Sometimes I have to cuss just to prove my damn point
Brothers need to come, with better, compositions
I write, and recite, to make, good position
In this, rap game here, we en-gineer
Stabbin up the jam yeah son shit's clear
And I be kickin rhymes in my own damn way
Beatin niggaz to the punch like Sugar Ray
Got the cool-ass style, that's cooler than the cool
My lyrics is the bullet and the mic is the tool
Peace to C-Seventy-Three, and C-Seventy-Fo'
Do a little somethin when I'm out on tour
Comin thru like narcotics for the antibiotics
Flappin shorty's stockings to the Space-like Sprockets
What you really need to do is just boogie your ass
It's not gassed, we got to make the good times last
Let the good times roll, cuz we in control
Take you out on your high less you payin a toll
Let the good times roll, let the good times toll
Take you out on your high less you payin a toll

Verse Two: Phife Dawg

Question
Why is that, MC's be wack
And major labels wanna sound like crap
Aiyyo Funk Dat!
Word to life I'm comin rugged
Cuz once you add the hip to the hop kid, it equals out to love
If the beat's fat I use it, some wack shit, I lose it
Refuse it, how could you chose it, it stinks Renuse it
Put down the mic kid, cuz you gets no dap
How long did it take for you to see you can't rap
The name is Phife Dawg, and I got nuff style
It doesn't take long for me to get buckwild
So bust what I'm swingin what I'm swingin when I swing
I rap when I rap cuz I never wanna sing
Go ask the last MC what happened when he said battle
I bust his ass in Cleveland now he's Sleepless in Seattle
Rude bwoy official comin with the ill grammar
Comin back on kids, like Joey Montana
We be the three MC's to make your mind go batty
Mad play, on WKRP in Cincinatti
So lord send a hon, if ya kyant send a han sen a man
An if ya kyan sen a man, come yaself
Cuz all deez bitin MC's, lawd dem somethin else
See I kick the styles that'll make ya ass melt
Money on my mind so never mind a trick
New York is the town and the team is the Knicks
World's greatest five footer rippin parties apart
Here comes Shaheed with the big green shark
Never had to rhyme about feelin what with lead
NEVER MIND DAT MON HERE COME DE DREAD

Verse Three: Busta Rhymes

We comin farrrr farrrr farrrr
Busta Rhymes is comin farrrr farrr farr
ya know ya hear me Star!
Bet your bottom dollah
Right after this jam about one million one two niggaz go follow
Whether it be to-day or to-morrow
Niggaz be collaboratin sickening
you beat them like they father
Ohhhhh shit check out what I saying
Ah-hah ah-hah ohhhhh ah-hah ah-hah
You know my niggaz don't be playing
Once upon a mah-hah-hacking time
I received the opportuni-ties to represent my first rhymes
To define, lyrical sensations
Black masons blowin up the spot
Just to represent the Nations
Three dimensions, tryclops, Mr. Busta Rhymes three eyes
Fat like a burger and fries
Mama-so-mama-saa-mamma-ma-ko-sah
Go back to the country to go check my grandmama
Eeeyah!! Bring it to the table at the meetings
Gathering large receivings delivering intellectual ass beatings
As I carry on with my proceedings
Greetings!!  Watch a nigga debut on premier movie screenings
But before I be face to face with my eternal resting place
I hope you find civilized every soul and every race
Sit dog sit!
Busta Rhymes forever on that ultrasonic shit!

      This is Us
     </title>
     <lyrics>
      [LL Cool J] {*Thomas harmonizing in background*}
I'ma give all y'all somethin, word up
Word up - all my live cats out there gonna love me for this one
Uh-huh.. they gon' be like,
"Yo you, you need to listen to that joint L made"
Heh-heh.. word up
That's the joint you gotta listen to, y'knahmean?
Check this out y'all

I got the key that fits the lock of a real dog's mind B
The answer to the question chicks ask most the time see
Why my man cheat and give some bitch my heat?
Slap me one day then Sunday he's so sweet?
To me and mine, this nigga's hard to define
cause he beefin when he broke but he arrogant when he shine
It fucks you up, you wonder if you wastin time
Mention marriage, he lit a Dutch and peeped out the blinds
What different niggaz feels in they hearts is scary
I used to say shit like,
"C'mon baby, you should be honored to share me"
She used to throw the cakes up, plus the burger was hairy
I used to have to think of shit to keep 'em comin, you niggaz feel me?
Baby or no baby I wasn't loyal or nuttin
Just me and my niggaz on tour, frontin and hittin somethin
Red lipstick prints all over my drawers
Oh you wanna be an actress huh?  Well my movie's hardcore
Like Dungeons &amp; Dragons; gettin brains in a Benz wagon
Step out, jeans saggin, crew laughin
Gettin blazed by the fiend for ten bones a piece
Nuttin but the dog in me needin to be released
This is us

Chorus: Carl Thomas

You know that I do, the best that I can
But you don't seem to love me no more, no more
I try to please you, and be your man
But you don't seem to love me no more, no more

[LL Cool J]
The flipside of the coin, what team you wanna join?
You in The Tunnel every Sunday exposin your tenderloins
in every rap cat's face, with some ol' flirty shit to say
Need to go home, wash your kids up, and put your tits away
Me and my clique in motion, champagne and Alize
Got your mind bubblin crazy, wanna flip Cool J
Spend your last on your hairdo, but you ain't save a dime
to put your child through college baby, now have you?
Go get a job interview, your bad-ass kids a curfew
and skip that "Bills Bills" shit broads is goin through
I know this prostitute who said that life ain't cute
Child born with a destiny only God can dispute
Players giggle and laugh, flashin gats and cash
My dogs don't care about you Boo, they like your ass
Told me if I call and your man answer, ask for L
so he can say, "No L live here," our code is ill
Tell him you about to catch a flick with Sherell
Plottin and schemin in the shower, masturbatin on the cell
The neighborhood hustler, that cat we all know
That nigga we grew up with, son from next do'
My dream was to flow and escape the hell below
but the demons in my life set fire to my dough
I thought about murder, I vowed my revenge
like the devil's pumpin hate through my heart with a syringe
This is us

Chorus

[LL Cool J]
They say a man gon' be a man, but that's only half the scenario
You nag a cat, you givin him a license to fuck a hoe
When a man come home late, he want his girl to say hello
Not hear all that bullshit, bout, "Nigga where you go?"
Fried chicken ready, t-shirt and panties at the stove
Messages written down, blunt rolled ready to go
Give me a hug, not too long, give me space
When a cat got issues don't need you all up in his face
Rub your breasts, kick back, smile a little
If it's rainin outside, chill, listen to the drizzle
Now kiss my chest, call me Superman
Pull down my boxers by the Calvin Klein band
(?) wash it, enjoy the flavor, I return the favor
This behavior, should save ya
from me all night freakin, with a nineteen year-old
half naked Puerto Rican, creamy ass leakin
Every man will agree, when she nag it's killin me
I don't always wanna talk about how the world is shittin on me
I sip some Alize and meditate the pain away
And get in my own zone where I wanna be alone for solo
Reminisce with photos
And missed opportunities to make some dough flow, you know?
Chill, relax baby, support me from the background
Believe in my dreams, instead, you and your girls sat 'round
complain about, who's tradin ass for cash
If there ain't no trust then just us can't last
This is us, I know you feelin that
Think about that shit, word up

Chorus

[Carl Thomas]
Your man, your man, your man
Everything we've been through yeah
All the places we've been yeah
Just don't know if I'll be the same again, ha
Ever since you walked all all over me, ha
And even if we bring this back together, ha
You know it won't be the same, no no no no
No no no no no, ha
Ohhh I, I, baby I, tried to be your man
Whoahoahhohhh, ohhhhh yeahhhhh
Hooo hooo hooo
Can't you hear meee?  Can't you hear meee?
Whoahhhh..

      [Royce Da 5'9"]
(Yeah) So you talkin about me so you can get known
'Til the .9's is out flyin out with the split bones
I learned you just talkin, it's just a song
Your words will not turn to sticks and stone
Don't worry about murder my mob won't do it
Only worries is worryin how I'm gon' do it
That mouth you got, it'll create yo' hype
And you might wanna watch it cause it could save yo' life

[Chorus: Royce]
I don't mess with what I can't leave in less than thirty seconds
You will rest in a box in back of a hearse if I feel threatened
You got your vest on but I don't know why cause my AK say it's just a shirt
You be bench-pressin the earth and not blastin or askin questions, first

[Royce Da 5'9"]
Yeah.. c'mon, yeah.. M.I.C...
Of all I'm a gangsta, the album is scary
I'm Malcolm, I'll get down if necessary (necessary)
By any means - in which
you breathe in the mic is the reason you left with a skinny team
This .9 rings, settin 'em straight
The rest, I'll show 'em what the five fingers said to the face
If, act hard and you will head for the Gates
And I don't mean the one in your backyard; I'm talkin Pearly
Christians call it sinnin (yeah) Muslims call it winnin
and witnesses call me worldly (worldly)
This life is full of the type of nigga that'll pull out a gun or a knife
Do it and run off in the night
We specialize in the truest to ever ride
You slip you lose your life, you blew it like a breathilizer
Asbestos flames come out of his mouth, he a rider
The next best thing to the Mafia and my motto is

[Chorus]

[Royce - over Chorus]
Yeah.. Rock Bottom nigga, yeah
T-Dot nigga, yeah, the M.I.C.

[T-Dot]
Spittin real life from this shit
AK rifle with clips is chrome with the knife on the tip
Or two .9's sit right on my hip, that'll light up your strip
And if you drivin let 'em die in your whip
Moms cryin and shit, fuck talk, better duck the lead
Cause them bullets poppin out the toaster like Wonder bread
Rhyme with your Lex out, chief in ex' house beaten
when I whip tecs out you stressed out bleedin
Wife and kids get X'ed out even
Kill stress out, catch 'em leavin while I'm in the next house squeezin
Stop breathin when barettas be spittin, I never be missin
We actin like the gun law never resistant (whoa)
See I laugh when niggaz be stuntin
Cause one flick of a button'll pop the stash and the triggers be thumpin
Dumpin niggaz ain't killin right, dealers ain't dealin right
Fuck the mic, real life, this is what I'm feelin like (like)

[Chorus]

[Royce Da 5'9"]
Uhh.. D-Elite nigga, yeah
Tre Little nigga, yeah, c'mon, yeah

So you talkin about me so you can get known
'Til the .9's is out flyin out with the split bones
I learned you just talkin, it's just a song
Your words will not turn to sticks and stone
Don't worry about murder my mob won't do it
Only worries is worryin how I'm gon' do it
That mouth you got, it'll create yo' hype
And you might wanna watch it cause it could save yo' life

[Tre Little]
Yo, whatever homie, you can go and take that chain off
Respect the pistol, it's official, Little got them thangs out
I hang out at bars where shots ring out at cars
I game all your broads like, "Ho, come with a star" (c'mon)
E'rybody know me, well at least in the D
Gotta be top three; Gordy, Zeke or me
Arrogant as a fuck, like "Damn, I match my truck"
Gun and chain ain't tucked, you don't wanna run up (you don't want it)
Yeah, it's just not worth it, I got stripes like a zebra
Make you run like a cheetah, I don't mind if we meet up
Your neck a lil' froze, then let me turn the heat up
Burger and the beef up, I'm like Kain when I creep up
Hold me down, run them sneakers
Homie I don't know your people, yeah I'm bout to fly my eagle man
And I don't care what y'all say in these streets
We deep, D-Elite'll Nyquil you to sleep, yeah

[Chorus]

[Royce - over Chorus]
Yeah, uhh, yeah
Yeah, yeah.. this that shit right here K
Yeah, shooter music nigga
We call this shooter music

      I Ain't tha One
     </title>
     <lyrics>
      Intro: girl, Ice Cube

[Ice Cube, do you think you could give me some money to get
my hair done?] How short's your hair right now?
[Well you know I get it done every week, and I need my nails
done too] Look, I'ma tell you like this

Verse One:

I ain't the one, the one to get played like a pooh butt
See I'm from the street, so I know what's up
On these silly games that's played by the women
I'm only happy when I'm goin up in em
But you know, I'm a menace to society
But girls in biker shorts are so fly to me
So I step to em, with aggression
Listen to the kid, and learn a lesson today
See they think we narrow minded
Cause they got a cute face, and big-behinded
So I walk over and say "How ya doin?"
See I'm only down for screwin, but you know
ya gotta play it off cool
Cause if they catch you slippin, you'll get schooled
And they'll get you for your money, son
Next thing you know you're gettin their hair and they nails done
Fool, and they'll let you show em off
But when it comes to sex, they got a bad cough
Or a headache, it's all give and no take
Run out of money, and watch your heart break
They'll drop you like a bad habit
cause a brother with money yo, they gotta have it
Messin with me though, they gets none
You can't juice Ice Cube girl, cause I ain't the one

Interlude One:

[Girrrrrl, you got to get these brothers for all the money
you can honey.  Cause if they ain't got no money, they can't
do nothin for me but get out of my face.]

[I know what you mean girl, it ain't nothin right jumpin off
unless he got dollars]

Verse Two:

Sometimes I used to wonder
How the hell an ugly dude get a fine girl's number
He's gettin juiced for his ducats
I tell a girl in a minute yo, I drive a bucket
And won't think nuttin of it
She can ride or walk, either leave it or love it
I show her that I'm not the O, the N-E, say
I'm a ruthless N-I double-G A
Cause I'm gamin on a female that's gamin on me
You know I spell girl with a B
A brother like me is only out for one thing
I think with my ding-a-ling, but I won't bring no
flowers to your doorstep, when we goin out
Cause you'll take it for granted, no doubt
And after the date, I'ma want to do the wild thing
You want lobster huh?  I'm thinking Burger King
And when I take you, you get frustrated
You can't juice Ice Cube and you hate it
But you see, I don't go nuts
Over girls like you with the BIG ol butts
It start comin out the pocket, to knock it
But when the damage is done...
You can only lay me girl, you can't play me girl
For the simple fact that, I ain't the one

Interlude Two:

[I don't care how they look if they got money,
we can hook up but they ain't gettin none.]

[Yeah I just make em think they gonna get some,
play up they mind a lil bit, and get that money.]

[Oh Ice Cube, can I have some money pleeeease?]

Verse Three:

Give you money why bother
Cause you know I'm lookin nothin like your father
Girl, I can't be played or ganked
Ganked means getting took for your bank
Or your gold or your money or something
Nine times outta ten, she's giving up nothing
They get mad when I put it in perspective
But let's see if my knowledge is effective
To the brothas man they robbing you blind
Cause they fine with a big behind, but pay it no mind
Keep your money to yourself homie
and if you got enough game
You'll get her name and her number
Without going under
You can't leave em and love and stay above em
I used to get no play now she stay behind me
Cause I said I had a Benz 190
But I lied and played the one
Just to get some now she feels dumb
To my homies it's funny
But that's what you get trying to play me for my money
Now don't you feel used
But I don't give hoot, huh, because I knock boots
You shouldn't be, so damn material
And try to milk Ice Cube like cereal
Now how many times do I have to say it
Cause if I have to go get a gun
You girls will learn I don't burn
You think I'm a sucka, but I ain't the one

Outro:

[But you said you love me!]
I don't see no rings on this finger
[Why you doin me like this?  I love you!]
Yeah you love my money, I got what I wanted -- beat it

      Tramp Dogs
     </title>
     <lyrics>
      [B-Legit talking]
Oh, ha ha
Man, all bitches be tryin' to run a funky ass game
They be like way out with that ol' shit man
I know, man what's up
You ever hook up with that bitch E hooked you up with
No man but I ran into this ol' school bitch though
Man she tried to run that same ol' shit
The same ol' punk shit
Man check it out

[B-Legit]
Bumped into a bitch named Candy
Met her late nigh, kind of perved off brandy
Dick on numb and I was strikin' the o's
And that's the same bitch that wants to fuck my mo's
Pass the chance, I wanna bone the bitch
I gave her my number with the code 0-6
I told her to call when the nights get cold
And maybe she can ride on the three times gold
Game much colder than a twenty below
Cause baby beeped back and was ready to go
Now my nigga told me when I'm in pursuit
It's nathin' but Lance open after two
So I hops in my Cut and I'm about tah
Take this bitch to my house-ah
No she ain't comin' from Legitimate B
Cause hoes to me is tramp d's
And that's a tramp nigga, a straight up bitch
Fuckin' with Legit cause she figure I'm rich
But I'm just to make her dome swoll
Wait till I get her in the day room
The day room man where I get the draws
Bang the walls cause it ain't no laws
Because soon as I get her I'ma spank her
Hit it real hard then I shank her

[B-Legit talking]
Ah yeah, she one of them late night hoes
One of them late night broads man, it's two in the morning ya know
Ah, I already know the program I know why shit is
Yeah I ran her pants ya know
Ha ha ha

[B-Legit]
And Candy was a bitch like dandy
Diggin' for gold, with a kid buyin' Huggies by the boat load
Black shear shirt with the see-through sleeves
Thicker than a block of that government cheese
She used to have a man but he's up state
Snuck when I callher but I stay
And dude'll never ever see baby again
She needs another nigga to giver her some ends
So I peeps game and plays the role
And tell her how good she'll look in some gold
That must have been it, her magical spot
Cause after that have baby straight on top
Ridin' askin' if Legit can mack
And I was tryin' to give the bitch brain damage
She can keep fuckin' Legitimate B
Cause hoes to me is tramd d's
And that's a tramp nigga, a straight up bitch
Fuckin' with Legit cause she figure I'm rich
But I'm just to make her dome swoll
Wait till I get her in the day room

[B-Legit talking]
Day room
Yeah day room
Shit
Really don't know what the day room about though
Yeah, you'll have to tell me
Tell me about that

[B-Legit]
The day room man where I'm gettin' the draws
And baby tryin' to strip paint off the walls
Bashed the bitch and hittin' it swell
Holdin' on to her fake ponytail
A nigga like Legit straight tore shit up
Hit it from the back and dropped a nut in her gut
And that's about the time that the shit had changed
The tramp dog bitch started runnin' her game
About bein' depressed, down and out
And havin' no mail in her bank account
But all I can do when I listen to that
Is give her a biggie and find a sack
Meet me at the track about 3:15
And we can talk about makin' us some green
Give me a call, the Hillside Hog
But bitch you'll still be a tramp dog

[B-Legit talking]
Yeah, it's like this though man
I played the game with bitches right, right
It's like this the first one comes wins ya know, right
And I'm undefeated, undefeated ha ha
And it's like this if the bitch don't cum when I cum
Then she cum when I come back
Oh like that, like that
Ya know what I'm sayin' right
If she want mail she ain't gettin' shit
Bitch you better get a job, or something
Ya know, bitch
Yeah so I come through the drive-thru
And you don't say shit bitch
McDonald's, Burger King what not Taco Bell
Really want the check though, ol' bitch
You owe me ya buck bitch
That's my money, ha ha ha
Motherfucker come off that shit
Look she got five sixty
Oh a real ho
Nigga that's rent at the Hillside Terrace
What I say, that's what I'm talkin' about
Hey man but now I'm gone
Hey man but find some hoes we can hook up with later on
Like that
Yeah, call the bitches back
Well I'll get 'em though

      Murder Made Easy
     </title>
     <lyrics>
      [Young Noble] (talking)
Outlaw, Outlaw
Bring your mother fucking Jersey Mob
In the name of Makaveli The Don, the killa motherfuckin Kadafi

[Akwylah - Verse 1]
Everybody wanna know how I live my life (pucka)
Where's my balls? (pucka)
Where's my ice?
No matter now I answer then, feel my stripes
You keep poppin shit, I'll pin my knights *dying*
At your grow dega
Smokin on your drow Flavor
Spit some pimp shit
Then dip with your old neighbor (come on)
And if you really, feel some type of way about it
Run up in your hood, then I'll shoot my fuckin way about it
This Jersey Mob, Outlaw, Akwylah
To my crew selling coke clinkin' cock dollars
We in the same game, eat the pain, maintain
All the snitches wanna see us in chain gangs
The hate for traitors, that's all a cop thought of
We live stool pigeons smokin in salt water *pigeon*
Only my lord and our crew know what happened to him
His family prayin 'cause one day they might back into him (uh-huh, uh-huh)

[Smooth - Verse 2]
With nothin to loose, I walk through clutchin my tools
Ice-grill make you wanna say what's fuckin with Smooth (yo, what's fuckin
with that nigga?)
I'm sick of these crews, actin like they've been payin dues
I put the heat to em, tell them niggaz kick off they shoes
What would you do in the position when it's us against you?
That Teflon mother fucker, can your head take two?
Shut the fuck up 'fore your luck's up
What you gonna do when your shit's up
Besides get dissed on nigga, and pistol-whipped up
Tied up, mouth taped up, layed out, and hit up
Leave you in pray, gotta give you a napkin to wipe that shit up
After the fact, holdin in time, shit up for lit up
High drilly and shit yeah nigga you know the mix-up
We that squad for real, Jersey Mob for real
It be kill or be killed, so we drawin that steel
I'm lovin the rush, Essex county doublin us, fuckin with us (yeah, yeah,
yeah)
We ownin enough, them rollers is bust

[Chorus - Akwylah] x 2
(Murder - repeated in background of chorus)
Murder made easy for dummies
Before you pull the trigger
Hit his pockets, take all his money
First you gotta be smart
Check his race and his bag
To see if he's strapped
And hit him once in the face
And that's that

[Trife - Verse 3]
Well where you at then?
When I needed you the most
I hit rock bottom
I couldn't see that we was close
Yo box, watch em
Now they all Champaign
Ballin campaign
Yeah that nigga fall in the rain
Dirty ya joints poppin like you greasy burger enflamed
Every verse I drop's another small piece of the pain
Shit'll never be the same
After we got burned
Niggaz is burnt out
And yo there's nowhere to turn
Like court adjourned
Without a quarter to burn
Short of return
To the same game in order to earn
Y'all niggaz don't learn
I ain't concerned by far
Spit six bars like gem-star, stitches, and scars
Niggaz dry snitchin, yo they intuition bizarre
Picture me starved
Without a partner, pitchin is hard
Listen, my jaw, to find the right position tomorrow
Is mission imposs?
I be yellin really my eyes
Niggaz kill me when they nod like they really alive

[Kastro - Verse 4]
You ain't shit without your homeboys
Y'all ain't no grown boys
I feel it all and no voice
Now you stuck with no choice
Get on the ground, give up your property
It's like monopoly
With Jersey Mob this time, they're ain't a mother fucker stoppin me
That's why I pop three in my throat
Wait for my shit to drop and it's murder she wrote
Forgot to pull it close
And I got enough to go around for everybody challengin
Guns, never silence, I'm still wildin like Allen
And Mister Jeru, well it's mob. all that deep shit
You can keep it
Fuck frontin, I ain't never kept a secret
My dog's swift, doin the hard shift in the jail
I'm still sendin the mail
We livin' in Hell
My mom dukes told me 'life is what you make it'
So watch yours close
And The Outlawz will fuck around and take it
I got these spinks payin a hundred a gram, fifty for half
I'll get em for thiry that's why I dump at last

Chorus

[Napolean - Verse 5]
We catch niggaz at the stop light
And do what's not right
It's worked for centuries
To the OG's and peace gites
We seat night, and we run through your chest
Got a bitch with your name on her breast
Up to set up your death
We watch your ass for ten months
If we gots em (yeah)
Then the first mistake you make (see them)
Mother fucker we gots you (got em)
We do it so cold
We make your niggaz think they saw a ghost
You untouchable niggaz don't even know we so close
(right next to you nigga)
Coast to coast, we spread so rapidly
Man, the niggaz sittin next to you answer to me
Cause we can touch you when we want to
So watch your tongue
We listenin closely man
Y'all know have no one
We got guns
Plus the ones that Pac left (uh-huh)
We got enemies
Plus the ones that Pac left (uh-huh)
We bang thug life, outlaw
Cause that's our job (yeah, yeah)
We backed by the Mob
And we hittin these niggaz hard
So what?

      Blows to the Temple
     </title>
     <lyrics>
      Check it
We can go, toe to toe, with the blows to the temple (NOT)
Not the Temple of Doom, so make room
for the Unamerican Caravan (who you down with?)
The B-Boys, Immenslope, Twilite Tone, Derrick and then some
I don't get rid of some faces
while marks be lookin hard, and they be beggin bases
They have too many cases, and now they got courage
Sorta like Goldilocks, tryin to take Pop's porridge
But I got, the story straight
Plus the name, I got rep, don't dare sleep
Slept and got, crept
An AC/DC spider went up the wall we mount
Now came down the Common the Common Sense, and now the spider out
(BOOM) A blackout, power failure
I ain't the Burger King, but I got a whale of blows
uppercuts jabs hits and hey niggaz
Cause I'm weird they call me Lemonhead, but I'm a Jawbreaker
and I break a Bean, but I'm not from Boston
I'm stronger, and faster, than Steve Austin
Common'll keep the camera movin -- I'm kinda fast!
I'm from a town called FRESH OFF A NIGGAZ ASS
And I'm about to go on like Stephanie Mills
YOU MUST be poppin pills, tryin to step to me
Cause to the left of me, WE got the U-A-C (whattup)
And comin up to the right of me, WE got the U-A-C (come on)
And in back of me, yo WE got the U-A-C
And in front of me (BAW!) is a dead man G!
We hit em hard!

..

Kick it
A duck tried to buck, but the vic got vicked
so I picked him, he's another victim of a circumstance
He did a dance like Ali (SAY WHAT?)
But he floated like a waterfly and stung like a C
Ya see, I ain't out here, tryin to be a bully
Nor am I pretendin to be a two-shoes goodie
(WORD IS BOND) that I got big balls homes
And if a player try to press me, I gotta break the zone
Here to stage a, OOH SHIT, up in the sky
You better watch out, I'm tellin you why
Common Sense is breaking, marks down, ah-follow-me-now
Yo Common Sense is breaking, marks down
Uhh, check it, check it, check it
I huff and I puff and I blow (WHAT?)
the motherfuckin house down, I guess you didn't know!
Homeskillet, WHERE YA BEEN?  Are you the boy in the plastic bubble?
Ooh you in trouble!
A tisket a tasket, you're gonna get your ass kicked
You better know what's in my jacket, fuck the basket
Oh, God damn CHILD, I mean it's drastic
You end up on a stretched cause I stretch you like Plastikman
Fuck with me ("you end up the in the cas-ket")
You flow ass pussy nigga, sucker duck bastard
(Yo Common calm down, you gots to calm down!)
This Grape tried to step to me, with his arms down
Lesson number one - when you're ready to throw
never step up talkin - that's like tryin to pitch, but you're balkin
And I'ma steal first, hide the base, but you base
You can call me Pencil Petey cause the marks I ERASE
In case of emergency, it's urgent see, that you see a doctor
You tried to Gamble, but I'm the Proctor
I knock that ass, bringin it down and then slash
Tried to play me with a skit, but now you got a gash
you character, for ya inherit a, neck brace
Makin ya thousand deaths times worser than a Screwface
But they call me Screwneck and I do wreck shit
So next time he push up in the jam, BOY YOU BETTER EXIT

Late Show in the house
U-A-C in the house
7-D in the house
R-T-A in the house
True B-Boys in the house
Dem Dere Dyslexics in the house
And we gonna fuckin blow the house down
Check it, hit em with a

Blood clot boy, you get bucked, tryin to fuck with the
Mario, Super Super Brothers like Mario
Here the Common, sucker clucks (what we do?)
Mission upon the loves, gettin kisses, and hugs
but then we runnin to a scrub that tried to bug
He's out to get some what they call em stunts because we bunt
(WHAT?)  But I don't bug, I just slide her, and hit her
Some be rumpy chump, with the chat chat chitter
Yo we did her but I betcha know I'm better on it
Now you got a 100 percent beef, it's just a beatdown
(UH UH AHH!)  Too late to try to be down
Brother your best bet, is to cover your eyes, like Dee Brown
(Cause it's a bum bum bum, bum-rush)
And if I ask who popped shit, the Caravan gotta bus
Sing it ("on that defense")
But our bumrush is well done, not medium rare
It's rare to see, an enemy within play
True indeed a lot of shit, is over he say she say
Me say, Warriors come out and play
And I'ma tear shit up and leave it like the day, after
And after we go around, and you hit the ground
then you know I'm down with the Blows to the Temple

      The Mask
     </title>
     <lyrics>
      [CHORUS]
Have you ever worn the mask one-two one-two,
M to the A to the S to the K
Put the mask upon the face just to make the next day,
Feds be hawkin me
Jokers be stalking me,
I walk the streets and camouflage my identity,
My posse in the Brooklyn wear the mask.
My crew in the Jersey wear the mask.
Stick up kids doing boogie woogie wear the mask.
Yeah everybody wear da mask but how long will it last.

[CLEF]
I used to work at Burger King. A king taking orders.
Punching my clock. Now I'm wanted by the manager.
Soupin me up sayin "Your a nice worker,"
"How would you like a quarter raise, move up the register"
"Large in charge, but cha gotta be my spy,
Come back and tell me who's baggin my fries,
Getting high on company time."
Hell no sirree, wrong M.C.
Why should I be a spy, when you spying me,
And you see whatcha thought ya saw but never seen.
Ya missed ya last move, Checkmate! Crown me King,
Hold my 22 pistol whipped him in his face.
Hired now I'm fired, sold bud now I'm wired,
Eyes pitch red but da beat bop my head
Hit the streets for relief, I bumped into the Feds,
I got kidnapped they took me to D.C.,
Have me working underground building missiles for World War III.

[CHORUS]
M to the A to the S to the K,
Put the mask up on the face just to make the next day.
Brothers be gaming, Ladies be claiming.
I walk the streets and camouflage my identity.
My posse Uptown wear the mask.
My crew in the Queens wear the mask.
Stick up kids with the Tommy Hil wear the mask.
Yeah everbody wear the mask but how long will it last.

[LAURYN]
I thought he was the wonder, and I was stunned by his lips,
Taking sips sipping Amaretto sour with a twist,
Shook my hips to the bass line, this joker grabbed my waistline,
Putting pressure on my spine trying to get L-Boog to wind,
I backed up off him then caught him with five finger to his face,
I had to put him in his place,
This kids invading my space,
But then I recognized the smile, but I couldn't place the style,
So many fronts in his mouth, I thought he was the Golden Child,
Then it hit me that's Tariq from off the street around Grams.
I haven't seeen him since fifteen, when he got booked for doing scams.
I tried to walk away but he wouldn't let me leave,
He ran up quick behind me asking, "Yo what happened to my nigga Steve?"
Steve was like this kid I went with back in Grammar School.
I chuckled knucklehead I seen him yesterday he's cool,
He's busted, "so who you checking for now?"
Probably some intellectual.
I kept the conversation straight and he kept trying to make it sexual.
Then his old lady tried to play me waved her hands up in my face,
Yo I told her check your man cause Bitch you acting out of place.

[CHORUS]
M to the A to the S to the K,
Put the mask up on the face just to make the next day.
Brothers be gaming, Ladies be claiming.
I walk the streets and camouflage my identity.
My posse Uptown wear the mask.
My crew in the Queens wear the mask.
Stick up kids with the Tommy Hil wear the mask.
Yeah everbody wear the mask but how long will it last.

[PRAZ]
3 A.M. in the morning on the Boulevard,
I'm still at large engaged with my entourage,
Me and Godfather and a 67 Dodge.
I stepped out the note to post up my guard
Searching for my car that was stolen from Scotland Yard.
My first instinct was to check the chop shop garage.
As I rung the bell someone tapped me on my back,
I turned around to look it was a rookie in a mask.
He said, "I got a itchin' on my trigger,
Don't move nigga I'm taking you for murder."
See cops got two faces like two laces on my Reeboks.
My knees knock as I step back for a claear shot,
Well did you shoot him? Naw kid I didn't have the balls,
That's when I realized I'm pumpin'too much Biggie Smalls.

[CHORUS]
M to the A to the S to the K,
Put the mask up on the face just to make the next day.
Brothers be gaming, Ladies be claiming.
I walk the streets and camouflage my identity.
My posse Uptown wear the mask.
My crew  in the Queens wear the mask.
Stick up kids with the Tommy Hil wear the mask.
Yeah everbody wear the mask but how long will it last.

     <lyrics>
      * originally appeared on the "Still Smokin': Chronic 2000" compilation

[DJ Quik]
Hey 'Pac, it's yo' boy
Hey man so far I've been listenin to your album
and I ain't heard nuttin you could kick back and smoke a beadie to
You know?

Yeah like that
Some of that mellow shit
Some of that shit that make bitches drink
Make niggaz think
And help you check a fat-ass bank, hahahah
So why don't you kick some of that shit, nigga only you know how
Hahahah, feel me?

[2Pac]
I'm barely standin, and plus my secondhand say it's midnight
Some Alize and Cristal guaranteed to get right
Like misdemeanors is a small thang
With DJ Quik in this bitch, I let my balls hang
Runnin through the street lights, cause we like, yo nigga
get your mobb on show em what a G like
Around the corner it's like Vegas, or better yet like Reno
Niggaz poppin, welcome to our casino, cause you and me know
hundred percent like a c-note
Lookin for a bitch that's half-black and filipino
And when I meet her I'ma offer her some indo
Tounge-kissin on the window of a pearl white limo
Don't wanna be your man, I'm your nigga
Touch me here, I'll get bigger
While I'm diggin I'll get deep into your liver
I'm game type
Love fuckin bitches in the same night
My words are aphrodisiacs if you say em right
The club be poppin so I'm stoppin at the Fat Burger
Look through the paper it's another black crack murder
The city's full of surprises, you can live or you can die
You can fuck on the first night, or try, in the late night

* DJ Quik cuts and scratches this sequence 2X*
"Last night.. last night changed it all"
['Pac] In the late night!
"Last night.."
"I don't give a fuck, where you gon'.. be"
['Pac] In the late night!

[Hussein Fatal]
Around my way we lamp, many styles get cramped
I clock rocks in the rain til my socks is damp
Ain't NUTTIN like bein a thug when I can just
sit on the Row of Death straight knowin that I'm blessed
Hussein Fatal, flawless fatality
Overdosin on crime, three steps from reality
Get up to get down, represent your town, last night
was poppin like like cocked glocks with hollow-tip rounds

[Kastro]
From bootycalls to bail sheets, it ain't no tellin
if I wake up in the county in my jail sheets
My intuitions and ambitions up in the late night
probably involves me comin up with just to see another day
Might be me who bites the bullet
In these streets where a man journey
With crooked cops and a society who tryin to burn me
I'm like a pit in a cage, spittin my shells in a gauge
Deadly as AIDS, niggaz gettin crossed like a maze
Now picture me livin my life like a king, maybe one day
Until then I'm livin Monday through Sunday
Bringin the gunplay for all these beefs and battles
When we collide, I'm a ride on that hide like cattle
Cowards best to skedaddle in the late night

* DJ Quik cuts and scratches this sequence 2X*
"Last night.. last night changed it all"
"Last night.."
"I don't give a fuck, where you gon'.. be"

[2Pac]
Money and multiple gunshots are shown, large amps are blown
Niggaz in low-lows, pursuin mo' hoes, then go home
The life of a California star, and when you see me
in the drop-top Jag', how many niggaz wanna be me?
Game is automatic, manditory I sell
To Live or Die, I survive, but with a story to tell
Cause when you gettin some riches, watch for dumb bitches
They have you labelled a rapist before you get to tongue-kissin
It's a mean world nigga you strapped, or be a throwaway
Will I survive the late night, to see dawn of day?
Nobody knows me, I'm a shadow
My army fatigues made for battle, pockets full of ammo
Cause when I'm out in the streets, I'm on point, where the static?
Too many done died from semis, so now we automatic
I dissapear whenever heated, ride whenever needed
for my niggaz up in Clentin gettin weeded
Continue to roll until I'm old, ride until I die
Supply long as you motherfuckers buy
My homies rolled by in a bucket, but they ain't short and duckin
Slappin niggaz known for tellin bitches FUCK-IT in the late night

"Last night.. last night changed it all"
['Pac] It's in the late night!

['Pac] Holla at me in the late night!

      * send corrections to the typist

[Intro]
We have the elegant styles of Chamillitary... hmm? what?
We have the elegant styles of the Chamillitary Band
On the bass drum you have the elegant Bose the Bobo
"The Big Face Spender", and on the bass guitar you have Tanto "The Human Beer Blender"
Give it up for Justo's Dirty South DJ of the Year
I'm sure y'all know the scratch patterns of uhhh...
uhhh... OG Ron C aka "The Jills in my Shills" oh!, you on fire baby
So as we get on to the proceedings this evening, it's yours truly...
Chamillitary mayne

[Chorus - singing]
You ain't gotta go home (you ain't gotta go)
but you gotta get the hell up outta here
If you got someone (somebody)
then go get you a room at The Holiday Inn
You ain't got no one (nobody)
than go have some fun by yourself (ohhh yeaaah)
But whatever you do
don't let the door knob hit you on the way out

[Verse 1]
Niggaz was throwin' rocks at the thrown and I got word of that
The sequel to The Messiah?  For what, I already murdered that
Niggaz hatin' on me but look at 'em, the nerve of that
Nigga this ain't this type of beef you can't take the burger back
Burn it back, into my pocket I'm tryin' to stop it
unless your mouth keeps leakin'
Dick back in your socket
How does it feel, to know you wasted your whole lifetime
Livin' your whole lifetime just to worry 'bout mine
Gimmick niggaz was dissin' me, he was fake they was missin' me
Came to replace and make history, B I made 'em history
You could feel like you real because that feeling
eventually gonna shrivel up when reality turns it into misery
You niggaz is killin' me with your wannabe me's
You a artist, we bosses the one's that fund the CD's
All you gonna-be, wannabe, gonna punish me please
You got me laughin', I'm askin' if niggaz wanna be Steve
Harvey, no your hardly, funny at all
*Runnin' the Game* not at all, homie your runnin' your jaw
We grown folks, kiddie schoolers need to go run up the hall
Nigga's borin', just ignore 'em and the dummy will fall
My brother is my descendant, we runnin' a mile a minute
Hut, hut! it's time to win it, I'll see you behind the finish
If you get there, quit there
Got your swisha lit player?
Blow smoke in the air for the Color Changin' Click, chea...

{*applause*}

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Ladies and gentlemen, homie must be on heroine
Victory for me, but he thought he would have the narrow win
My aim is to blam', when I load it inside the barrel
and put the third eye on him and do a little more than stare at him
Poet, I know it I'm mister modern day Shakespeare
I'm a writer, survivalist; what it is?  It ain't fear
The absolute truth is just something some niggaz can't hear
He don't live here no mo', he got convicted he ain't here
How the heck you set fiction on a table, put truth aside
What you speakin' my nigga, you can't look me into my eyes?
The good Lord spoke the truth and that just got him
crucified, y'all scared of the sharp dagger
Your tradin' your truth for lies
Look me in my eyes, nevermind I ain't tryin' to spook ya
Voice of the present, the past, yup I'm the future
Soon as you speak the truth all the hater'll try to
mute ya, but if you the truth arbitrators will call ya Koopa
Martin Luther King Koopa
Many of 'em will listen, but if you can't take the
heat than get ya hot ass out the kitchen
I heard words from Makaveli ridin' was the ambition
so I bomb first on fake niggaz like I'm in his position
"Aye Chamillion you trippin'", nuh-uh I'm handling business
Raise my hand to the man and my right hand as my witness
I got a fo' to the fizzle that's sure to damage your
fitness, but it ain't really even that serious to tan ya with stitches
P you actin' suspicious, you know me better than that
If it was for a false reason I would never react
But you know me better than rap, niggaz was tellin' me fact
So you could miss me with publicity if they tellin' me that, never that...

{*applause*}

[talking]
Thank you, thank you I appreciate the support
Everyone please take your seats, I'm not done...
there's more...

[Verse 3]
In this world of falsifying where niggaz be claimin' they real
Turn around and tell you a lie 'bout what he paid on his grill
Same nigga that talk big 'bout what he made on his deal
The same that ask me for advice like "They don't pay me Chamill'"
Rappers ain't really real only a few of 'em ball
pissy colored diamonds yup I'm one of the few of 'em y'all
Talkin' about yo' piece and chain and a few lil' cars
Four thousand to five thousand for what you do as a star
But keepin' money in the vault is the hardest part of the art
Knowledge got my crew smart even when my crew is apart
"Chamillionaire you did 'em wrong, why don't you get a heart?"
If I showed it to you would you see what it could do in the dark
Whether you like it or not don't really matter to me
'cause most of the love I normally keep inside my family tree
So you can gossip 'bout what really happened with
Hatta and me, or you can gossip how so and so way better than me
It don't really matter to me, because I'm done with it now
The maturity level that I'm at isn't even fun for a child
So set your mouse pad on the internet and punish my style
Or set your Reeboks on the streets of Houston runnin' me down
It's whatever I been better at provin' a nigga wrong
Tell Goliath I don't need rocks to prove a lil' nigga strong
So tell Watts, forgive me I'm groovin', I'm in my zone
Property of Mike who?  He ain't here that little nigga gone

     <lyrics>
      [J-Zone] + (female)
(Hey daddy!) Hey beitch
(I wanna be your BITCH. How can I qualify?)
I mean, it takes a real special kind of lady
to be with a Boss Hog, y'knahmsayin? I mean
You just can't be any girl to be a Hogette
You gotta be that kind of girl you can take home
and show your grandmother, y'knahmsayin? I mean
You know what? I'm-I'ma tell you
I'ma tell you what kind of girl you need to be
Check it out, heh

I need a girl with extensions in her hair
Or she can be baldheaded, shit I don't care!
A crazy nag with a bad attitude
That's all I need to put me in a good mood
She beat her kids with a switch and joined the street gang
Start shit with other girls when they try to run game
Standin at the bus stop, waitin for the Q3
Settin metal detectors with her bootleg jewelry
Or a rich bitch from Long Isle' that actin like Hilary Banks
High as the national debt, straight whylin
Bougie, yet she drinks 40's of brew
A Yale graduate, yet she snorted all of her room
Used to search for a regular girl like a ass
But you got nuttin to lose when yo' hoe is low class
Faith beat up her pops for sport, Jan's a klepto
She can steal a 747 out an airport
My new broad is neurotic with a slight mustache
But somethin 'bout the crazy bitch won't let me quit her
She went trick-or-treatin with her kids to rob the homeowners
God damn nigga, maybe you should reconsider!
Maaan fuck that, I got no love with the wife type
I never met one, so I stick to the trife type
Got fo' kids, low class, but I can spank her
And got a trackin device, strapped to her ankle
So she ain't in the club, flirtin with Pharrell
She's home by eight o'clock cause she don't wanna go to jail
Met a Adrian Balboa bookworm type
But on the low a coke sniffin snow blower had to let her go
A grimy Far Rockaway thugmatic bitch
Suburban-ass soccer mom drug addict bitch
Every girl I date seems to be a nutcase
And I'm the only dude that never been to jail the slut dates
Lisa, Angela, Pamela, Robin
I don't need 'em, them hoes got problems
But I can't stay away, but if they ever need a place to stay
Stay the fuck from around my way, ya crazy bitch!

[Chorus: Boss Hog Barbarians]
Somethin about you - makes me wanna make you my wife
But bitch you trife and baldheaded with no job
Callin all hoodrats and psychos
They always wanna fight hoes
Drunk, high, about to do a bid
You wanna be a singer and you got four kids
Bitch you crazy, I should quit'cha
Aww fuck it, I'ma stay wit'cha

[Celph Titled]
Silky, filthy, her gold teeth like sunshine
That's why I had to dedicate at least one room
To all them gangsta bitches from the neighborhood
Cause I'm the one to fuck you like no other brother would
Type to go to Burger King, splurge on some onion rings
Purple eyeliner, earrings the size of onion rings
These are things I like in my girls, I ain't playin
They the ones from junior high, skippin class, misbehavin
Gettin fucked in the stairwell, pregnant at 14
Runnin drugs back and forth in projects at Fort Greene
Asked if she could use a gun - she said, "Which one?"
I said the M-249 she said, "Yeah that's that shit son~!"
Keep her pussy clean but bitch grimy as hell
If cops find out she sell she'll be confined to a cell
She don't write no love letters, she snuffin them thug heffers
DipSet and D-Block, she only listen to thug records
Perm in your hair or even a curly weave
Buck fifty scar across the face as cute as can be
I need a bitch that's a rider that's the one for me
But she ain't gettin out of jail 'til I'm a hundred and three
And really most of y'all dudes is too soft for these broads
Offerin cards and candy, asian nails and massage
But I just pull out the garage in a hooptie, ready for action
For girls with tats on they breasts that read "Thug Passion"

[Chorus]

[J-Zone]
Man fuck that, this is dedicated
to all my flaky, psychotic, drama queen ex-bitches
Doin time for stealin blank checks
Got enough kids to start a fuckin Pop Warner team
Doin more drugs than the cast of Different Strokes
Jealous ex-boyfriend havin rap groupie tramp punk hoe
Stop callin me, don't e-mail me, don't come to my shows
Kill that I love you talk cause love went out with the Reebok pump
I got nuttin for y'all but a case full of Bitch-B-Gon
and a can full of Hoe Repellant, abra-cadabra BITCH DISSAPEAR!

     <lyrics>
      [Jay-Z]
Guess who?  Uh, uh-uh uh-uh
Jigga, ya heard?
Uh-uh, a-Timbaland, ya heard?
Uh, Twista, ya heard?  C'mon, c'mon
Uh-uh, uh-uh, g-ge, ge-geah
Yo.. yo.. ye-yea, ye-yea
Turn this up.. yo, yo, yeah

When the war's on, the 4's are drawn like pictures
The niggaz is all gone when these triggers get witcha
Nigga before long you need stitches in your longjohns
A.K., t-t-t-t, heartbeat, t-t-t-t
Eight figures you fake twitchy niggaz can't stop (that)
Jigga, Twista my nigga Timb on the hot track
How you gon' stop that?  We can't be slowed
Niggaz (?), look at your clothes
When I'm in crazy mode, three-eighty blows like
Maceo, leave acey holes
That's just Jay-Z doe, crazy flow
Rhyme great, dominate your radio
C'mon, get your gun, your mask and gloves
I don't ask for love, I blast 'em up
Respect my gangsta dude, or your life's in danger dude
Doctors pushin on your chest tryin to bring you through

[Chorus: Timbaland] + (Twista)
All my party people gon' do what? (Gonna get buck)
Get some liquor in the gut (So whassup?)
(Get them lighters lit up, make them get up
with somethin the East and West gon' bump)
All my party people gon' do what? (Get crunk)
Get some liquor in the gut (So whassup?)
(Get them lighters lit up, T got some gangsta shit
that's beatin in yo' trunk)

[Magoo]
Fuckin with Mag, nigga end up in a hospital
Sittin on the corner of the bed, sick cause of what I said to him
On a track star beef take it in the kitchen
Cookin MC's all niggaz taste like chicken
Hittin 'em high, bitin they ear
Tyson on a muh'fucker vampire style, I'm a bloodsucker
You turnin into a mad ducker, tellin ya dog
I'm at the Rucker with a bad Puerto Rican chick
Fat as my cash and she a dick sucker, get up outcha car
You ain't goin real far, see the chainsaw?
Breakin the law, like turnin a dyke
when it come to that man that just like Mike
I don't care what you like, I'll make you run in outer space
If you go to court man, only wish you got a case
For real, I'm fuckin faced on a hill of ice
Mag hot now nigga 50 G's the price

[Timbaland]
Timbaland good for that - {*beat plays, he scats*}
{*scatting*} - I invented that
Hear the hi-hat, hear the bassline on the track
Remember "One in a Million" when I left ya back
Producers sayin, "How you get your sound like that?"
I don't know playa, I'm a creative cat
Got party people dancin to dis and dat
Got party people sayin, "This a dope-ass track!"

[Chorus]

[Twista]
Timbaland hit 'em with the um, ah-um, ah-um-ahh, you gon' do what?
Stop frontin you bumpin the new cut
like a shoe ah, um ah-um ah, hit 'em in the gut
Twitchin and itchin to get up, I hit 'em up
With some skanless to vibe to and ride to
with the stanky inside you - listen to while a freak lickin you
Go on a bogus mission to, somethin you crip-walk in the kitchen to
Somethin you bump on the porch or the park
Or pump it while you displayin yo' heart when you flex on a mark
You can play it to clear your head from drama with the feds
and all the homies like down for when they in the dark
Used to rock up at the block club, players wasn't ridin slick
You can let your mind cruise for miles
They can't tell no sucker who's allowed, with a strap on the mic
I'm thinkin how can I move the crowd, move the crowd

[Chorus] - repeat 2X

[Timbaland]
.. bounce wit me, bounce wit me, bounce, ow ow ow
Ow ow ow-ow ah, shake wit me, shake wit me, shake wit me, shake..
.. bounce wit me, bounce wit me..
Shake wit me, shake wit me
Ow, one time, bounce wit me, bounce wit me
Yo, ahh

Remember when you first found me?
I was workin at Burger King
Now take a good look around me
Look at all these cars, look at all these girls
Why you always tryin to put down me?
Why you always tryin to put down me?
You get 'round your friends and try to clown me
Why you always tryin to pull that boo-boo?
I'm gettin tired of all that bullshit
Always talkin dis and dat
Your girls screamin, "We looove him!"
See girls, they LOVE me
Girl that's just, only Tim
Yes, it's only Tim
Whatchu talkin 'bout that's only Tim?
Yeah whatchu talkin 'bout that's only Tim?
Cause

[Timbaland: repeat 2X]
I made it this far (this far)
Made it without yo' money (yo' money)
Made it without yo' car (yo' car)
Made it without yo' naggin (what?)
Now look who's the star (whoo!)

[Timbaland]
YaknowhatI'msayin?
Why it gotta happen to people like me, I don't get it
I don't understand it
That's why people like myself, only hang with self
Hahaha, and nobody else
Easy now

      Freaky Tales
     </title>
     <lyrics>
      These are the tales, the freaky tales...
The tales that I tell so well...

I met this girl, her name was Joan
She loved the way I rocked the microphone
When I met Joan, I took her home
She was just like a doggy all on my bone
I met another girl, her name was Ann
All she wanted was to freak with a man
When I met Ann, I soked her pans
We ended up freakin' by garbage can
The next young freak I met was Red
I took her to the house and she gave me head
She likes to freak was all she said
We jumped in the sheets and we broke my bed
There's another girl, her name is Mary
Talked about sex and the girl acted scary
I heard she was freakin' for my homeboy Jerry
Took her to the house and I popped that cherry
Young and tender, sweet Denise
Get her in the bed and the girl's a beast
I tell you, homeboy, If you get a piece
She only talks about signin' a lease
I met this tender, her name was Lori
And a X-rated movie wouldn't tell her story
She had a twinsister, her name was Lisa
And just like Lori, she's a real dick pleaser
My girlfriend's name was Michelle, I freaked her well
Her pussy got hotter than flames in hell
I geed this girl, her name was Tammy
I didn't wanna do it cause the bitch was flammy
She had a best friend, her name was Jane
I pulled to the side and I spitted that game
I met a lot of freaks in my lifespine
Freaked one night with a girl named Pam
The very next day I saw her with her man
One week passed and I was in her again
I had an old tender, her name was Janie
She was thirty-two and I was only eighteen
She likes to freak, she's just a fiend
It really didn't matter when I saw her in jeans
I wanna big freak, fat and slobby
I kick on back and I watch her mouth
Two tons of fun, big mama jama
A country-girl from Alabama
I met this girl, her name was Betty
Her pussy got wet and it smelled like death
I was tired as hell, I was drippin' sweat
But I was all up in her tryin' to hold my breath
Bake and shake us, I met this freak in Vegas
She said her name was Donna
She was a pitty little freak from China
I said I don't pimp or gigolo
I'm havin' so much money that I don't need a hoe
You can break yourself but you can't break me
You never met a player like $hort, baby
I knew a dick sucker named Betty-Jo
Took her to my home and we did it on the floor
The girl got freaky and I tell you more:
She was down on her knees beggin' to blow
She's like another freak named Ren`
You get her alone and she'll make your day
Like Burger King, she knows the play
But a freak like Ren`, you can have it your way...

These are the tales, the freaky tales...
These are the tales that I tell so well...

I met this girl, thick as hell
Only sixteen, said her name was Linell
I took her to my house, I could not wait
Her shit was much tighter than Central Safe
Let me tell you this since we talkin' young
I met another girl, said her name was Yvonne
Always talkin' about havin' fun
Once again in the bed I got it goin' on
I'm Sir Too $hort, couldn't be no punk
I try to get funky like female funk
So when you see me comin' or see me goin'
I keep my money, let the hoes keep throwin'
I once met a tender, she did it for free
On the Foothill bust number forty-three
All the way on the back she was workin' me
Had my big beatbox and I was jammin' the beat
I met this freak named aunt Winell
Macked on the baby like an ice-cold vet
Everythin' she had is what I get
Cause I'm Too $hort, baby, I don't play that shit
I met another freak, her name was Rita
Baby thought that $hort just might eat her
I told her like this, she can suck my peter
Or even go home cause I  knew I didn't need her
Scratched her name off my telephone book
Never again I took a second look
Cause the next young freak, her name was Sharon
She kept lookin', well, I kept stairin'
Her booty was stuffed in the jeans she was wearin'
She never left, she cutted out
I know you all know what I'm talkin' about
There's a freak named Shane, such a sinner
She smokes that pipe and she's gettin' thinner
Shane is cool but her mind is gone
One fat rock and it's goin' on
She had another buddy, came by my place
Thick ass bitch, said her name was Grace
She walked in the door wearin' a lace
You shoulda seen that look that was on my face
She's like this tender named Belinda
Homeboys call her Belinda the Blender
She gave head like she made it up
She was twenty years old with a big round butt
Had a girl slick like olive oil
Her father was rich and the girl was spoiled
When she got mad he blood would boil
But I rapped her off like I'm lookin' a toy...

These are the tales, the freaky tales...
The tales that I tell so well...

Shockedy life, Friday night, it's goin' on Too $hort
Three weeks ago I met this freak
She followed me around like Mary's sheep
I hitted around the corner and when she came
I grabbed her by the arm and I asked her name
She said it was Nina and her man's in Santa Rita
I took her to my home and homeboy, I geed her
Set her on the way the very next way
Playboy $hort was ready to play
I bumped to this girl, her name was Roseanne
We hitted the motel and got it goin' on
Holiday Inn to the break of dawn
When I took baby home, I freaked her mom
I knew this tender named Shanie
I took her to the house and let her freak on me
Baby was a fan, she loved my beat
But I wouldn't raise my leg to let her kiss my feet
I met this freak named Yolanda
Rolled baby doll like a brand new Honda
I was on top and she was up under
The bed hitted the wall and it sounded like thunder
I once had a datewith girl named Kitty
She was so fine with big fat tiddies
All night long she was actin' shitty
So i macked on baby like I was Frank Nitti
There's another girl, her name is Rose
I use to roll baby like brand new Volvos
I never saw Rose wearin' clothes
She's a pimp house pet, ready to pose
I was ridin' down the street when I met Janet
Her booty was bigger than the whole damn planet
Ass everywhere, I just can't stand it
Tried to poem it but I could not manage
I had this freak, her name was Bunny
Said I was the only man who ever called her honey
Everythin' I did to her was funny
I macked on bunny and I took her money
Eight tonight a date with Shirlie
She was really short and her hair was curly
If you saw baby you liked this girlie
She was so fine I went to get her early
Shirlie was freakin' like a girl named Rachel
Her bite was vicious and it sure was fatal
She liked to kiss all on my neval
Those are her lips on top of my label
I knew another freak, her name was Candy
Real big lips and they came in handy
I smooth got worked and it was so dandy
I hooked the brood up with my homeboy Randy
He did me a favor in return
Gave me a lizard, said her name was Laverne
Baby got tossed and I got it on
I grabbed the mic and started to sing my song
My young homeboy heard me rap
And said he had way more freaks than that
So I told him like this: they might be freakin'
But, boy, you never had that T-P-Treatment...

      Get Up Outta Here
     </title>
     <lyrics>
      [Hook]
You ain't gotta go home, but you gotta get the hell up out of here
If you got someone, then go get you a room at the Holiday Inn
If you ain't got no one, then go have some fun by yourself
But whatever you do, don't let the door knob hit you on the way out

[Chamillionaire]
Niggaz was throwing rocks at the throne, and I got word of that
The sequel to the Messiah, for what I already murdered that
Niggaz hating on me, but look at 'em the nerve of that
Nigga this ain't this type of beef, you can't take the burger back
Burn it back into my pocket, I'm trying to stop it
Unless your mouth keeps leaking, dick back in your socket
How does it feel, to know you wasted your whole lifetime
Living your whole lifetime, just to worry bout mine
Gimik niggaz was dissing me, he was fake they was missing me
Came to replace and make history, B I made 'em history
You could feel like you real, because that feeling eventually
Gon shrivel up, when reality turns it into misery
And you niggaz is killing me, with your wanna-be-me's
You a artist we bosses, the ones that funded c.d.'s
All your gonna-be wanna-be, gonna punish me please
You got me laughing, I'm asking if niggaz wanna be Steve
Harvey, no you're hardly funny at all
Running the game not at all, homie you running your jaw
We grown folks, kiddy schoolers need to go run up the hall
Niggaz boring just ignore him, and the dummy'll fall
My brother is my descendent, we running a mile a minute
Hut-hut it's time to win it, I see you behind the finish
If you get there quit there, got ya swisha lit playa
Blow smoke in the air, for the Color Changin' Click g'yeah

(*cheering*)

(*talking*)
Ha-ha thanks a lot, appreciate it 'ppreciate it
Hey mayn, shout out to everybody out there all the fans
That been staying down with a nigga, you know I'm saying
Through his whole career, watching him grow
Watch us make it to that next level, we on our way baby
You know I'm saying what up George Lopez, Juan Gonzalez
Sup mayn, y'all holding me down still mayn
Shout out to my niggaz out there on the West, what up Balance
Ha-ha yeah ha, shout out to my niggaz over there on the East Coast mayn
Selene what's up baby Garvey what's up dog ha-ha, Chamillitary mayn

[Hook]

[Chamillionaire]
Ladies and gentlemen, homie must be on heroine
Victory for me, but he thought he would have the narrow win
My aim is to blame, when I load it inside the barrel and
Put the third eye on him, and do a lil' more than stare at him
Poet I know it, I miss the modern day Shakespeare
I'm a rider survival is what it is, it ain't fear
The absolute truth, is just some'ing some niggaz can't hear
Mike don't live here no mo', he got convicted he ain't here
How the heck you set fiction on the table, put truth aside
What you speaking my nigga, you can't look me into my eyes
The good Lord spoke the truth, and that just got him crucified
Y'all scared of the sharp dagger, you trading your truth for lies
Look me in my eyes, nevermind I ain't trying to spook ya
Voice of the present the past, yep I'm the future
Soon as you speak the truth, all the haters will try to mute ya
But if you the truth, all pertrators will call you Koopa
Martin Luther King Koopa, many of 'em will listen
But if you can't take the heat, then get your hot ass out the kitchen
I heard words from Makevelli, riding was the ambition
So I bomb first on fake niggaz, like I'm in his position
Ay Chamillion you tripping, naw I'm handling bidness
Raise my hand to the man, and my right hand is my witness
I got a fo' to the fizzle, that's sure to damage your fitness
But it ain't really even that serious, to tear you with stitches
P you acting suspicious, you know me better than that
If it was for a false reason, I would never react
But you know me better than rap, niggaz was telling me facts
So you can miss me with publicity, if they telling me that never that

(*cheering*)

(*talking*)
Thank you-thank you, I appreciate the support
But everyone please take your seats, I'm not done there's more

[Chamillionaire]
In this world of falsifying, where niggaz be claiming they real
Turn around and tell you a lie, bout what he paid on his grill
Same nigga that talk big, bout what he made on his deal
This ain't ask me for advice, like they don't pay me Chamill'
Rappers ain't really real, only a few of 'em ball
Pissy colored diamonds yep, I'm one of the few of 'em y'all
Talking bout no piece and chain, and a few lil' cars
Four thousand or five thousand, for what you do as a star
Now keeping money in the vault, is the hardest part of the art
Knowledge got my crew smart, even when my crew was apart
Chamillionaire you did 'em wrong, why don't you get a heart
If I showed it to you, would you see what it could do in the dark
Whether you like it or not, don't really matter to me
Cause most of the love I know I'ma keep, inside my family tree
So you can gossip, bout what really happened with Hatta and me
Or you can gossip bout how so-and-so, way badder than me
It don't really matter to me, becuase I'm done with it now
Maturity level that I'm at, isn't even fun for a child
So set your mouse pad on the Internet, and punish my style
Or set your Reeboks on the streets of Houston, running me down
It's whatever I've been better, at proving a nigga wrong
Tell Goliath I don't need rocks, to prove a lil' nigga strong
So tell Watts, forget me I'm grooving I'm in my zone
Property of Mike who, he ain't here that lil' nigga gone

(*cheering*)

(*talking*)
Ha-ha ok we gon chill out, we gon chill out mayn
We gon try to just keep it moving, you know I'm saying
Focus on the music, give the fans some'ing to ride to
You know I'm saying, "The Sound of Revenge" will be
One of the best albums, to come out the South
And I put everything on that ha, let me give a couple shout out's
Shout out to Shahiem Reid, up there at MTV2 I appreciate the love
Flex, Ke'noe, Killa Mike, Big Girl, 'sup Nancy
We gon shake these haters off, know I'm saying ha-ha
Who am I forgetting, James Shepard 'sup up my nigga
'Sup my nig' ha-ha, O. Gizzle 'sup my nig'
I know somebody gon say I forgot 'em but man
I'll get you on the next go my nig', ha-ha
